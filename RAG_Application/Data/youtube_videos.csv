00:00:00,1971,Slay The Reneeâ€™ Way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db6xDfRArpE,social media branding is super super important if you have an online presence or you are trying to create an online business with the right branding strategy you can technically build your Empire online and make a lot of money but first you need to actually learn about brand so stick around and I'll get into all these different branding tips that I have for you guys what's up boss babes it's your girl nah and this is slay the Renee Way a place where passionate entrepreneurs can come to grow glow and succeed in their online businesses so if you're looking to start build or just learn more about how to be a successful entrepreneur you're going to want to subscribe because I'm dropping gym after gym after gym but today we're talking about branding strategy and branding tips so if you're interested just keep on watching in a couple of my recent videos I've been telling you guys how you can actually create branded content for social media using canva and I've also showed you guys how you can actually book plan bulk schedule and book create your content so if you haven't seen those videos make sure you check those out but you can't just go into blindly brand new your social media you actually need like an effective plan so what I'm going to share with you guys is a branding strategy that I have personally used in my businesses and something that I know is tried and true okay so social media branding strategy tip number one is your profile photo no matter which social media app you're using you actually need a profile photo that's going to immediately draw your customers attention and what I have personally learned is just simply using your business logo may not always be the best way to go because using a business logo I feel like though it is your professional Brands logo which is perfect like you need that but people online want to actually connect with a person not a logo you know what I mean so maybe try to actually take like a professional headshot or get a professional photo of you taking in and use that as your brain profile photo or just to see how it differs from you actually using your brand logo I've personally done both and they have worked well for me but I will go ahead and say that I think using my actual face has connected me to more people in my community as opposed to using the logo sometimes people might automatically just assume that your spam which we have to understand you guys we're just online so it's very easy to not be sure if someone's account is actually real or if they're a Spam account so try considering getting a professional headshot of yourself taking and using that photo as your logo or as your brand photo and make sure it's not one of those regular selfie photos you want to actually get like a nice smile you want to show your face being very clear a smile is something that's just going to attract people to you because you want to look friendly you want to look inviting you want your profile to look like you're a person with whom someone wants to do business with so try to make sure that your profile photo is not only professional and very high quality but also that's just my strategy number two is include information about yourself not just business information you guys I mean every information about you as a person because people genuinely want to connect with the person who is behind the brand though you are a part of your brand you have a lot of different interests and things outside of just being the entrepreneur or the CEO of your business so include as little or as much information about yourself as you wish to and your bio or whatever it is that there's a section where you can actually type out information about yourself this is like your blur to get people to want to get to know you as well as get to know your business and get to know your products and your services and things like that so so for example if you're a dog lover or a cat lover like myself it might be something interesting that can connect you to a potential customer just based off you guys similarly like in cash or if you or if you're a mom like I always make sure that I let my customers know that I'm not only just a solopreneur but I'm also a mompreneur so that's something that has connected me to very you know different moms online who are also starting online businesses but just be very careful to not include too much personal information and not give your customers enough information so they want to learn you but you don't want to be giving all your business out in your bio so that's something that I highly recommend doing tip number three which we have recently just talked about in a couple of my previous videos is using the right posts or the right photos in your post so what you want to do is make sure that the post that you're including in your social media profile are directly related to your Niche so for example I always like to use cosmetic brands because that's what I'm most familiar with but if you're in a cosmetic business industry you don't want to be including like um health and fitness content on your profile because that won't directly relate to the customers or your target audience we did just go ahead and talk about how to actually brand your photos using canva and how to get free stock photos but if you guys need a more in-depth video on that go ahead and comment that down below because I will get that out for you guys I definitely think that using the right photos related to your Niche is very specific to actually creating like an authentic brand and curating a brand that people can't remember when you're thinking about posting don't just post random photos make sure that they're on target they're actually going to get the customer to want to shop and then that they're related to the product that you're selling or the service that you're offering and don't sleep on the power of actually using selfies you guys something that I love doing is including like or maybe once every other week including like a selfie of me and office doing my work or a selfie of me at the post office shipping orders or something like that so that people get to like know that you're an actual real person behind running your business it's something about selfies that get a lot of Engagement because you're posting so much content that's promoting your service or promoting a product that sometimes the customers may miss just connecting with you and one thing that I'm really big on is connected with my audience so don't sleep on the power of just dropping a selfie and you know including like a caption that's relatable to your next a huge part of your social media branding strategy is obviously the colors and the visuals because everything that we're doing online is visual it's supposed to catch your eyes it's supposed to catch your attention with division we have photos videos different types of highlight reels and things like that so it's important to actually use the correct colors that are associated with your brand I also included a little bit of snippet of how to actually create a brand kit in this video so you guys just have to make sure y'all check that video out using similar colors that are related to your brand and your Brand's identity is going to make it easier for that customer to recognize your brand like say for example your brand colors are pink gray and white every time your customer sees those three combinations of colors together the goal is to get them to think of you so that no matter where they are that brand color is going to be locked into their into their memory like Coca-Cola we all know that's like red we're looking at a red logo and you can associate Coca-Cola with that bright red logo so I feel like if you keep implementing the same colors and making sure that that pink is the exact same pink across all of your posts that's why it's important to actually write down the hex codes of your um colors and your brand and you want to keep them like written down somewhere or lock them in your brand kit and canva and make sure that they are consistent you don't want to use different shades of pink unless they're the same different shades of pink that you normally use make sure that your colors are seamless and consistent across all of your posts similarly to number four branding tip number five is to also use the same fonts as you're using consistently throughout your entire brand basically this keyword is consistency consistency consistency you just want your customers to actually be able to recognize your brain's identity and be able to associate your brand logo color and fonts with your brand it's also going to make your brain appear more professionally to know that you are being consistent and not mix and matching fonts here and there I'll give you an example when I very first started my business I wasn't exactly sure what type of font I wanted to use so so it took me a lot of time to actually settle on two fonts that complemented each other well because I just had so many different font options so what I will say is head over to canva design a couple of different text Graphics that you're going to post to social media play around with different fonts that complement each other well and stick with those two fonts that's why it's important to actually write down these things that you like about your brand your hex code for your colors and your font names for your font so that way no matter where you're at no matter what program you're using you're going to be able to use those same colors and they'll same fonts for every single post every single email and even your website if you check the description box below I will go ahead and Link this blog post I can't actually created for how you can actually find the right fonts for your business and how fonts are able to coincide with each other basically an entire typography lesson posted by canvas so if you're interested in that and you're a little bit confused on which fonts you want to use check the link in the description box so I got y'all covered tip number six is going to be to actually use the right social media platform for your Brand's content sometimes entrepreneurs start to use all the different social platforms as far as marketing goes and that can become just so overwhelming it's so many different strategies algorithms and different processes you have to go through in order to post to tick tock Instagram Twitter Facebook even Pinterest and then also YouTube so what I will say is when you're first starting as far as branding goes a good branding strategy for me was to focus on one social media platform at a Time Master actually getting a hang of posting publishing branding your content and learning the algorithm for one social media app before you Branch out and try to do all of them so that you don't overwhelm yourself what I will say is that it's better to learn as you go as opposed to trying to absorb and learn so many different pieces of information as far as marketing goes for all of these different platforms also based on your target audience kind of get a feel for which app will actually be best for the product and service that you're offering your audience so for example if you are are trying to market products to men who are 65 and up you definitely don't want to go on Facebook because there's statistics that show that there's not a lot of men in the 65 Plus Age room who are on Facebook but if your target audience is women from the ages of maybe 13 to 25. tick tock actually has that audience that you're looking for over there same thing with Instagram you just want to do your research on the different social media platforms that you're thinking of using and will they actually benefit the services in the product that you're trying to Market to your audience because it will be a lot of waste of time if you got on Facebook and you're trying to Market to your audience but your audience is not on Facebook so do your market research on these social media platforms and actually use the one that works for you practice it learn it get comfortable with it before you start trying to do two and three at once that's my personal piece of advice tip number seven is my favorite tip as far as branding strategy goes because tip number seven is know your audience know the audience that you're marketing or branding your products for a lot of entrepreneurs including myself at the beginning get misconstrued with that you can actually Market your product to everyone that you can try to sell your one product to to 1 million people when in reality that's our it's honestly impossible if you are trying to be successful when you're first starting your brain strategy should include the amount of people in the specific person that you are trying to sell that product to so that's why I always say in every every one of these videos I feel like target audience target audience target audience because I feel like it's one of those things that just people skip over because they feel like they're able to sell to everyone and that's how you end up wasting money on ads wasting money on products that don't sell and just wasting time period so know your audience know who you're selling to and don't try to sell to everyone it's okay that you are having 1 000 people versus ten thousand people because these 1 000 people are the people who actually genuinely want that product you know what I mean ten thousand people ten thousand followers is good and all but are those 10 000 followers all interested in your product you know what I mean so I always just say like know your target audience do that research up front so that you don't waste time waste money and then end up like you failing when technically you're not really failing you just never really had the Right audience to market to in the first place so so save yourself the headache girl because I'm telling you right now this is one of those things that you must do in order to be successful so tip number eight is also a really good one you guys is to share stories y'all probably heard the saying somewhere online or something facts tell but stories sell and I just want to go ahead and include that on the screen again facts tell but stories sell okay one thing that I have learned in all of my years of being an entrepreneur is that being more personable and sharing a story or an experience or something that is relatable to your audience is actually what will convince your customer or give you that trust in your customer before they actually purchase a product or your service if you analyze what some of the really big people in the industry are doing or just any entrepreneur who's very very successful you're probably following them because you clicked with their story or their story was something that made you feel like I really connect with this person or I understand where they're coming from and I love that they're using their story as a way to pitch their product like for example I really commit myself for being able to build community like talking about how I really value community on my channel has helped me to grow an even larger Community because I just feel like when we started entrepreneurship Journey not only are the people in our personal life kind of like I don't really understand what you're doing how are you going to just quit your job or how are you just going to start selling this product and you lose friends you lose family you just lose a lot of people but when you have a community of people who understand those struggles who understand what you're going through how you're trying to be successful and you connect with them authentically that is something that I genuinely wish that I had when I very first started but I quickly and very quickly began to attract people who were similar to me and who just also felt like Community is what I need like I need people to talk to who can understand what I'm going through and not only understand it but give me information and share valuable ideas amongst each other so that is one way that I have used my personal story to connect with people will sell my products and also just have authentic relationships with people online but another way is I have I I've openly talked about in every platform that I'm on that I am a mother I'm a young black mom and I do this for my child the reason why I work from home is because us I want to be able to provide her with the lifestyle that is not only financially free but I want to homeschool full-time up until I can't homeschool anymore so I'm providing myself with the luxury of being able to work in the comfort of my home but also providing my child with the lifestyle that I feel best suits her and our family so if you can share a story or an experience about whatever you're selling these are the things that will help people who are looking to shop with you relate to you not only relate to you but become inspired by your story and want to sell and want to purchase your product now don't ever lie don't tell a lie when you're telling your stories be real like be real to your audience because I'm telling you authenticity is key but facts tell story sales that was tip number eight let's move on to tip number nine tip number nine is Piggyback in office tip number eight which is to be who you really are on social media I always always say this authenticity it trumps all those other fake people out there who are betraying a life that is not necessarily realistic to what they actually look like off camera or offline so I heard a lot of people say like fake it till you make it and while that may be true in certain instances don't take that and run with it understand what fake and tell you make it means I'm not saying that you should lie but you should also show your lifestyle on anything that you're doing so I'll give you a personal example again when I very first started this YouTube Channel showing customers how I was packaging orders and I love this the I love this story because it stuck true to me and it really has helped me to connect with more people and build this channel to where it's where it is today and where it's planning to go in the future one of the things that I did was I packaged a couple of orders my very first couple of orders from rosemary Cosmetics I maybe had three sales within the first day or so so I packed those orders but instead of just packing those three orders I packed about 10 I packed about 10 boxes and I was filming the video showing how to package orders but with the purpose of that video was for was to be helping entrepreneurs not learn how to package and ship their products at home so the fake it's how you make it yeah I did that partially but I wasn't completely faking because I did have orders within those but I just felt like showing three orders which wasn't a long enough video and it wasn't helpful enough people want to see a repetitive process and so the point of that was to continue doing the same repeated steps and to show you how your process will look from start to end so but with that story you guys after doing those videos a couple of times and after um sharing how I'm personally going to package my orders I started to actually attract customers and I also started to attract like Community who wanted to learn more things about how you're packaging orders at home and it just it was one of those things I was like I'm not I'm not lying about what I'm doing but I'm definitely trying to teach and I'm trying to show so I didn't know what I was doing at the time until I saw the numbers the sales started to come in and I just was like oh my God this traffic is coming from YouTube so I do want to say like be who you really are on social media show up as yourself because the more you try to fake it like fake yourself it's going to be harder to put up that image after some time and people will be able to detect when you're lying or when you're or when you're stepping into a role of someone's lifestyle that's not truly your lifestyle which is why y'all don't see me doing anything luxurious or anything like that because yes I do have the lifestyle that I want for myself but it's not glamorized my entrepreneurship journey is no it's not ever going to be glamorized because this is not a glamorous lifestyle this is hard work okay so that's what y'all see hard work and dedication but I do I do think that showing your customers who you truly are will it will give you that trusting relationship with your customers so that will obviously benefit you in the long run if you are looking to sell your products to your customer before we move on to tip number 10 I need to give you guys a list of four things that your customers absolutely need and want from you first one is honesty second is friendliness third is value and help and the fourth is humor like be a little bit humorous be a little bit Goofy and be a little bit I always just say relatable because some people are going to feel like adding humor to their post Maybe be their personal preference but I can tell you right now I literally laugh at myself and I feel like it's okay to laugh at yourself sometimes like girl ship these boxes in the wrong box and went all the way up to the post office and literally had to unpackage them and repackage them in the post office it's a story time type of thing it was my personal experience it was funny and it just makes you appear more relatable and authentic so now let's move on to tip number 10. tip number 10 is something that I have been working on recently and it's absolutely working for me so I want to share with you guys be consistent with your posting I always say like out of sight out of mind and that's real especially on social media when we're getting Fair tons of different Medias and posts and Brands and entrepreneurs and all of these different things are happening by the boatload every single day it's hard to remember somebody if you're not being consistent so what I have noticed for myself is the second that I'm not able to keep up with my posting based on what's going on in my personal life it reflects in my business and that's okay that is perfectly okay because that's why as an entrepreneur your job is full-time though you're able to take time out and do vacationing based on your finances and things like that posting on social media is key but consistency trumps everything if you're not consistent with it it's truly no point of even being on social media because you'll lose your following you'll lose the engagement you'll lose the want to buy if you're posting consistently your audience will see your post they will engage with it they will talk to you you will build community relationships you'll grow your following and these are the things that are going to help you to actually convert to a sale because of your consistency a customer can't help but see your post if you're posting consistently three times a day friends every day like for YouTube I'm now posting Monday Wednesday and Friday every day you guys will see a video from me so these are the things that will help you in the long run as far as your brain goes I'm telling you the most successful people are super super consistent so stick with it don't get if you fall off schedule your content in advance bulk create your content so even if life gets a little bit hard your content's already done for you and you can just schedule it to be posted oh tip number 11 is a good one as well you guys make sure that you find your voice and use it for good it is super important to find your voice using social media branding as a way to find the voice or the um identity behind your brand or the tone in which you're going to convey to your audience it's super important to getting in front of the Right audience and changing people's lives okay we could all be talking about the same thing I'm not the only the person on YouTube right now talking about how to Brand your business and the best tips to Brand your business but finding that voice and finding that way that you connect with your audience will set you apart from others and it honestly will help you in the long run I feel like it's you're using your voice for good and what I mean by that is when you find your voice you find your people so like I always say just being who I am I've connected with so many people who I didn't think that I would connect with but relatability in my post and the way that I am as a person which I have had those same similar experiences with my favorite YouTubers my favorite entrepreneurs my favorite um just the content creators in general just based off their Brand's voice so we are all different in our own way and we have to accept that that's why I always say like don't be afraid to be different or weird or whatever that word is that you feel like is going to make you shy away from posting because you don't feel like you have the same way of delivering a message on somebody else that is exactly why you should deliver it because someone else is going to connect with the best off the way that you're portraying it as opposed to how this person is portraying it everyone has their Vibe everyone has their Niche everyone has their way of doing things so find your voice stick to it and make sure it's really you so that when you get onto camera or you get onto your social media it's effortless it's flowy it doesn't feel like force the second it starts to feel like force now you're starting to make it feel like work and honestly being an entrepreneur if it starts to feel like work that's just when it gets stressful like it's obviously your job but you want it to be fun you want to have a passion behind doing it so that you just have a good time doing what you're doing and I personally have a great time pulling out this camera talking to y'all giving y'all tips about things that I have learned over the years and then connecting with you guys after you comment down below so take a second right now if you have already go ahead and drop a comment in the section let me know that you like this video and give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you're happy with your girl so far but let's go ahead and move on to tip number 12. I feel like tip number 12 is something that we should already know but I will go ahead and include it is just in case you're thinking that you can get away with not doing it find a professional logo or design a professional logo for your business something that a lot of solo entrepreneurs think that they can get away with is getting on social media and not having a logo associated with your brand um I will go ahead and say that's just not that's not going to cut it it's very very easy to get looked over or looked past because if you're not having a actual logo or graphic to represent your brand customers are shopping specifically online so with us being an online based business you need to have a couple of different things that are going to represent your online business your logo your brand colors your fonts so invest in it yourself by you know getting a professional to design it for you or creative yourself using canva I do have a video here if you don't know how to actually design a logo for yourself using canva for free but I will just go ahead and say y'all make sure you got a logo for your business tip number 13 in this video is to actually use video content as your branding strategy whether it be pre-recorded or using live Instagram or Instagram Tick Tock live YouTube live whatever it is Implement live videos and video content into your branding strategy and I'll tell you why your audience is just going to trust you more if they can see and hear from you the more that you're able to connect face to face in a more relaxed setup or even if your setup is super professional to know you're still getting to directly engage with your audience one-on-one as opposed to like how I'm posting this video right now this video has to go up and then you guys can comment but I'm still not able to directly engage with you um comment back to any questions that you have going live unless you're in the premiere right now shout out to y'all but I just feel like the more your audience sees and hears from you the better it is as far as engagement don't hide from your target audience you guys I know that is very very uncomfortable to get in front of a camera or to be on live a lot of people feel like if you're hiding you got something hot and so that's why I'd be like it's okay if you're not perfect at doing it the best results come from just doing it stop over analyzing and just get on live one day and see what happens okay you'll be surprised I use me as your witness because I feel like the first time that I got on Instagram live on my business page completely changed the scope of my entire business not only did I connect with like tens of tens of people I actually generally made real friends on this very first very first first Instagram live I was able to create long-lasting friendships long-lasting customers long-lasting relationships with people um just all sorts of things came from just trying it I was very afraid but I did it and it changed my life so I want to go ahead and encourage you guys to if you haven't already try this is your sign go live or create a video content using your face and post that to your social media and just see let me know what happens the next tip is to be an expert in your field be an expert at whatever it is that your Niche is in or whatever it is that that product or service that you're trying to offer is keep in mind I know you're probably thinking expert like I've already said this before you guys it's okay to not appear or have the tone or the voice of an expert like that's different as an expert in your Niche or as an expert in your business what you need to do is be well researched and know more than your audience will know okay that is something that is obviously going to take time which is why I always say don't ever start stop learning as an entrepreneur you learn something every single day the second you start learning you're not doing well for your business because there's always going to be something new that you can add to or an experience that you haven't heard about or tool or resource is something to learn every single day so stay researched and stay disciplined and learning a new skill or try to become more of an expert in the topic that it is that you're discussing with the audience and don't get over work by hearing Network expert all you need to do is know more than your audience but I will go ahead and say if you decide not to invest in the knowledge in your business ask yourself this question would you trust a person or would you purchase something from a person who doesn't have anything to offer or teach you about this product or about this niche probably not you want to go with someone that you can trust their knowledge or the information behind doing something that's just how it goes especially with us being online based businesses that's why I just say learn a new skill or learn something new every single day in your business never stop learning the next tip is to think outside of the box try not to get caught up in looking at what other people are doing even if they're in the same field as you or if they're selling similar products as you don't pay attention to what they're doing stay in your lane focus on what you're doing and think outside of the box okay you don't put yourself in a box by thinking that you have to do something the way that someone else is doing it think outside of the box think about something that you can do that's very very unique to yourself and for your customer um there's a hundred Brands selling bread and tissue but each of them has something that's a little bit different they're offering something a little bit different from their competitors so that they set theirselves apart it doesn't matter if there's five different brands of bread on the Shelf one of every single one of them got something different and unique that they did that put an edge over their competitor you know what I mean you have to be different than most of the leaders because that's the way that you become a leader being different I know sometimes that word different can make us get a little bit fearful about trying something new and out of the box but I'll tell you one thing most of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world did something in a completely and Innovative way that no one else has seen or heard of before and that is what got them the success that they have so pride yourself on being different and pride yourself on starting something in a way that you've never seen before because that could be the ticket to your success also whenever you get like a new idea or you have an inspiration behind doing something get a notebook and a pen or a piece of paper or notes on your phone and write it down even if you can't do it right now write that thing down because when you're stuck on doing something or when you don't have any ideas as far as like what it is that you could be doing you'll go back to those notes and you'll say ah I remember that one time I wrote this thing down now I'm a little bit stuck in what I should do I think I'm gonna try to do whatever that thing was I always give a notebook and a journal just in case because ideas come to you doesn't always mean that you're going to be able to stop what you're doing and like implement the idea right away but hold on to your ideas because these are your ideas that are coming to you at whatever time and I always just say like trust your intuition because you'll get ideas based on something that you found useful for yourself or for your customer and that means that it's probably going to be beneficial so don't lose that idea just keep it somewhere tucked away the next tip is to show gratitude and appreciation to your followers or your customers or supporters I feel like if you ignore your customers or if you ignore your followers eventually they're gonna start ignoring you back so though you're getting all these sales and you're making all the success in your business show that love and kindness and that appreciation and return to your customers I can't tell you how many times customers have emailed me DM me commented on the post and told me how appreciative they have been of me just including like a thank you note a handwritten thank you note in all of my packaging because I feel like if you took that time out of your day to come to my website and actually purchase a product from me it takes nothing for me to sit there and write a personalized thank you note to you as the customer that's just my way of showing like my genuine appreciation for not only you supporting me but having trusted me to shop with my my products and then also every sale that I get contributes to my family so I feel like I owe you that gratitude because not only are you helping me personally but you don't see the people that I'm taking care of that yours that your order was able to help me do so so I'm just always like a very appreciative person in general but if you never tried that before like creating a thank you post or a appreciation post on your media on your social media before this is your sign to start showing that love back to your customers and your followers they will appreciate it you will start to engage better with them and they will feel like they are helping you in a way that is just genuine this is just human to human interaction this is just basic um I feel like this is just basic human nature to want to be showing appreciation you know what I mean so they want to support you but they also want to feel like though you appreciate their support so try to implement that into your brand new stuff okay this one is a really good one too you guys try to create giveaways or give away freebies every often every so often or as often as you feel like you you can afford to do something that I have learned is that like we were just saying about the showing gratitude if you give your customers care and you show them that you're not trying to just be super salesy like you also care to connect with people in a different way um something that I have just learned is that like offering a free service so one time I did a giveaway where I was offering you know I I want to get this amount of emails or I want to get this amount of subscribers to my email list but after I reach that goal I will go through randomly select three names and I will be providing a free website design service a free consultation and a free gift box full of all these products so that giveaway was very very successful it was when I reached maybe like 700 or so I can't really remember the follower amount that I reached but every time you reach a milestone as far as your business goes if you get 100 orders you get 100 followers I feel like those are things that you should be proud of for yourself but your community is who helped you get there so in turn you can you can afford to give something away if it's a sample of a product if it's if you're creating an ebook and you can afford to give away an ebook to some to one person you know do things like it will show that you can build trust with your your customers and then in return that trust with your customers I just feel like it's very easy to convert to a sale later also there's always a goal in mind when you're doing a giveaway so like I was just saying for getting 1 000 followers I want to give away a website design service but with that in order to do that you have to complete these three things as far as the giveaway goes don't make it too complicated but definitely make sure that there are certain parameters that your customers or your followers have to abide by in order to participate in a giveaway have a goal set for yourself if you want to get 50 people to subscribe to your email newsletter like I said send them to the link in your bio tell them to subscribe once you see their email name in the bio you will randomly generate those names into a giveaway um or and then once you select that person you will send them an email or tag them on social media that they've won and I'm telling you it really works so if you haven't given away something for free or if you haven't done a giveaway right now y'all need to go ahead and try that this year okay you guys we are at the very last tip in this video and I just feel like this is a great way to end this video because I have been talking about this recently in a lot of my videos and I feel like I'm gonna have to continue to reiterate this because in my experience I have seen a shift in my growth as far as what this tip is so the very last tip as far as social media branding goes is to plan okay if you're right now currently just winging it and you're just getting online aimlessly throwing out content and posting things when you feel like it as as they come to you I can tell you right now you won't really get very far and that is because we're in a world where everyone is using social media everyone has an online business and everyone is trying to become a content creator so content is getting put is getting posted hundreds of times a day if you're just posting sporadically your content will get lost in the masses and why I say it's important to continue posting you don't want people to forget about what you're posting or forget about you or your business so that's why I always say plan ahead and like I was just saying in this earlier part of this video I did just show you guys a way that you can plan create and schedule your content to be posted automatically for you I feel like planning not only saves time it also makes sure that your customer is not only when is looking forward to when you're posting but they just know that they're going to see a post by you they know that they're going to get an update they know that they're going to get an Instagram live on this day a YouTube video on that day and they're going to see a real posted tomorrow or whatever the case may be the more frequent your customer is seeing you the more frequenture on their mind which means the more frequent they thinking about shopping so that is it for this video you guys if I have given you a tip or just two that you found was helpful please go ahead and like this video let me know that you enjoyed it it really please please please you guys go ahead and give me a thumbs up subscribe to the channel and turn on your post notifications because y'all don't want to miss when I'm

xCIH3RA8_4c,"Finally, a stress free social media strategy (THAT WORKS).",Unknown,30821,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xCIH3RA8_4c/hq720.jpg,2024-07-23 00:00:00,949,Erin On Demand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCIH3RA8_4c,what's up beautiful people I'm Aaron and this is Aaron on demand and today we are going to talk about how to create a killer social media strategy that is stressfree okay there are so many questions surrounding creating a social media strategy especially as more platforms are coming and emerging so some of the questions you may have are which platform should I be on should I be on multiple should I just focus on one do I Niche or do I create content that just Vibes with me that I just love long form or short form how frequently should I be posting should I post educational content or relatable content should I be scheduling content or posting when I feel like you wo Chow okay there are so many questions and there is so much advice swirling around the internet and this video is really I'm hoping that it takes the pressure off because there are going to be so many different answers that you hear from different people based on what has worked for them and the whole idea of this is to find what works for you the goal is for social media to not stress you out and to be a creative outlet and to also generate income cuz let's be real we all want to make some money so let's get into the nitty-gritty I'm going to try to make this video as compact as possible and then if you want me to expand on any of these parts then I can make separate videos out of those questions that you may have so let's get into it first things first should I be on all platforms or only one now here's my advice I think you should focus on one but have a presence on multiple and by that I mean put most of your energy if you could put 80 85% of your energy into growing one of your platforms and then the other 15% to maintain a presence on the other platforms this could look like repurposing this could look like quick and easy content that just helps that platform stay alive then I would go ahead and try that route because if you really narrow in and only put your energy into one platform you never know what could happen these platforms could shut down they could start charging us to being on them like I don't know you just never know what can happen so I think it's always safe to at least have a backup platform even if you don't have as big of an audience on there at least you have something that you're building and growing and also people when they love you on one platform they are very likely to follow you on another so don't miss out on that opportunity either you're naturally going to see those numbers on the other platforms that you have less focus on increase simply because you are putting so much focus on your main platform also keep in mind that it's a lot easier to balance platforms when each of them has a different purpose so for example if you have a YouTube channel and you really focus on business on your YouTube channel but then your Instagram you have personal tips and more of your health and wellness Journey there but you're still sprinkling in some of that business and then on your Tik Tok maybe you have very casual talking head advice giving videos maybe you only do q&as on Tik Tok and so this helps to kind of segment your content so you're not thinking so hard about having to repurpose or having to create content for all of these different platforms you kind of know what direction or what works well for each platform and also that can take a little time at the end of the day when it com to picking your platform pick the one that you enjoy creating on the most honestly you're only going to create if you enjoy creating and so you can grow really fast on YouTube you can grow really fast on Instagram you can gr grow really fast on Tik Tok it kind of just depends on which platform makes the most sense for you so I recommend kind of experimenting on all of them and then seeing what sticks for you okay next thing to think about is do I Niche or do I create content that I love now first I want you to think about the type of person that you are and the long-term goal of you creating content will you get tired of posting the same type of content in the same Niche is there variety within this Niche or will you feel like a broken record you have to answer these questions for yourself so that you can really understand if niching is or isn't for you now there are some benefits to niching a lot of times if you have a video that takes off and it is within a specific niche then you can really narrow in on that and create more videos like that and your Channel or your socials will likely grow very quickly the only issue with niching is that it can feel so confining and as years go by if you don't want to continue to talk about that or if the thing that blew up for you is now no longer as trendy or as Buzzy or people aren't consuming content about that as much anymore it can be really hard to kind of dig yourself out of that and pivot so I think it's really important to have some type of focal point with your content but not overdo it to where you have no variety and you feel very very very confined I always say focusing on growth instead of focusing on good content can really leave you feeling bored so this is why I recommend layering it's a technique that I've kind of coined as a way to kind of merge the two where you're creating content that you love but you're also creating it with some type of focal point so I implement this a lot on my channel where I'm layering in different things so business and social media or Creator economy is like the foundation of my channel that is where you're going to get a bulk of my content but in that I'm layering in Vlogs where you see my family where you see me getting dressed I also like to you know be cute so fashion and beauty is not so farfetched from my content I love good music so that is something that we fold into the Vlogs there are different ways that you can fold in parts of yourself into your content where it's still on brand and aligned but it doesn't leave you feeling so restricted so I have a whole YouTube Playbook where we explain the layering technique and how to really narrow in on your layers so that you can grow and you can enjoy the content that you're creating now the bit question is should I focus on long form or short form content and the answer is you need to focus on whichever one fits into your lifestyle the best and whichever you have the best skill set in so it's kind of a twofold but whatever fits best into your life so if you are I always use this example a mom on the go and you have 15 minutes in the carpool line what can you do with that 15 minutes um this might be popping up your phone getting a little um car mount while you're sitting there and talking to the camera maybe answering some questions or doing some quick little witty storytelling things about you and your kids or whatever your Niche is about but on the flip side of that what are your skill sets so if you are not skilled in popping up your camera and telling a quick story maybe you're extremely long- winded or you have to do a gajillion takes or you know you prefer more of a vlog style content because you're really great at editing and shooting and you have a bit more creativity and that's more of your skill set then you have to follow what skills make the most sense for your content and also what um your lifestyle actually allows for so so here's the difference with short form you have to be able to tell a story very quickly you do not have time to be prefacing and doing all of adding these extra details and things in short form is about getting the storyline across very fast with long form you have to know how to keep people watching and be very engaging throughout the entire piece of content so they are a little bit different whereas short form you need to hook them fast long form you need to hook them and keep them for a long time now if you are a long form person and you really want to take YouTube specific seriously my YouTube Playbook goes through so many things like how to create your channel Vibe which types of thumbnails you should be creating to get people to click on your videos so finding that thumbnail style and also how to outline your vide so that you do maintain that engagement throughout the entire video okay so now it's the part where we discuss what type of content you should create should it be educational or should it be relatable and my answer is is both if you can strike a really good balance with both of these types of content you are winning because educational tends to be moreo friendly while relatable tends to be a lot more sharable so you're going to get that search engine content and you're going to get that sharable content that people can really relate to now I have found that both of them work really well on all platforms so if you want to sprinkle in Vlogs and do educational content on YouTube if you want to sprinkle in some cute little fun skits or some witty little I don't know quick jokes on Instagram as you also create that content that's also very educational and save friendly these are all very important tactics to mesh together into your social media strategy falling in one or the other it it works but it's really great if you can strike a balance with both remember educational content is probably content that's going to get people onto your page especially if you're somebody who's trying to promote your business your products um maybe not necessarily if you're only trying to be an influencer but that relatable content is going to help them stay it's going to help them build connection to you it's going to make them pick you over someone else if they're selling the same type of product or having the same type of Workshop okay so you know what type of content you should be creating now how frequently should I be posting and should I schedule this content let's get into it when it comes to how frequently you should be posting I always say post as frequently as your quality can remain the same so if you start posting five times a week on Instagram or on YouTube or on whatever platform and your quality starts to dwindle down meaning that you know your content just isn't good people aren't people aren't consuming it as much people aren't enjoying it they're not engaging with it and you just notice that the quality isn't there then decrease your frequency now if you notice that you are uploading a lot and it's not bearing on your mental health and you can handle it then continue that uploading schedule so the most frequently you can upload without diminishing the quality of the content I say go for it now my advice is to do the most sustainable thing at first with you YouTube at least once a week if you're going to be uploading long form if you're uploading shorts or repurposing to shorts then I say go for as much as you can even once or twice a day it's never going to be too much for short form content especially on YouTube shorts or Tik Tok because that frequency is is so much content as for Instagram I say if you can upload three to five times a week on Instagram and it's quality post then that is amazing I also have a video where I talked to an Instagram rep and I will link it down below and I'll put it up here but he shared all of these different tips on how to max out your Instagram engagement and following and so I will leave all those tips well all those tips are in that video so I will link it down below now when it comes to scheduling I am not a big fan of scheduling especially if you are posting for your personal brand now if you have a business and the these are things that you need to get out if you're like promoting a product like I'm sure for the top three page as we're getting that back going we are going to be scheduling those posts because those don't really ride on my personal brand now with my personal brand I do like to post in real time it just feels better to me and it just feels more authentic to me but if your schedule does not align with that then schedule your post by all means the whole goal is to get the content out there so it doesn't matter as long as you can get it out there then do that okay a few other long-term tips to consider prioritize an email list I cannot stress this enough I love substack I've been using it as more of a personal newsletter it's kind of like blog meets newsletter meets social media it's just a really really cool platform and I I don't know if y'all are sick hearing me talking about it I'm actually about to make a whole video about substack but it doesn't matter where you host your newsletter host have a newsletter it can just be once a week that you're sharing even once every other week that you share whether it's random thoughts you've had things you found that you love things that caught your eye little mental nuggets that you want to get off your chest it can be like a personal diary or it can be resources for your community whatever it is start pulling people from social media to your email list because this is where the power is and you have so much more control and autonomy when you have an email list because you just never know what can happen on social media another thing to consider is to have a good digital product that you can lead people to I shared a couple times throughout this video my YouTube Playbook it is $10 it is loaded with information on how to really max out and monetize your YouTube channel in as short amount of time as possible and we really go through so many incredible strategies creating your channel Vibe I have gear lists like different gear packs that you can purchase linked in there so you don't have to do the research or figure out which camera should go with which lens should go with which might I also have things to help you navigate your channel Vision your ideal subscriber so it's just loaded and this is really important because if you want to start making money from social media immediately and not necessarily um depending on brand deals or bonuses or you know things like that you can have your own digital product that you are pushing people to purchase and then lastly promote your other platforms on your main platform don't be scared to like pop up your Instagram on YouTube or to share about your Tik Tok on your Instagram like people will never know that you exist in those spaces if you don't tell them and this is just going to grow your overall brein okay I hope this was helpful I hope that this video is going to open your eyes to creating a killer social media strategy without all the stress and pressure if you would like me to go more in depth about any of these things that we discussed today then leave them in the comments below and I will see you on the next one bye for now

Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2peLV3tges,so listen the rumors are true there is a proven and profitable way to turn your social media accounts into a sales generating machine for your business transforming your existing social media strategy from a time- wasting activity into one of the fastest and most effective ways to start generating more leads more clients and more sales and in this video I'm going to show you seven of the most effective social media marketing strategies that are working right now so you can just follow these steps and avoid all of the mistakes that lead most people to failure so with that said let's dive straight into to one of the most important strategies of all something I call the marketing master plan also a big thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video but more on that later the marketing master plan is my secret weapon when it comes to creating effective high-converting and ultr profitable social media marketing strategies whether I'm creating a marketing campaign for meta Google Amazon or a smaller agency client like a plumber roofer or dentist first off you need to make sure that you're doing the right things in the right place for the right people at the right time and this is why the first step in the marketing master plan is the model the model is all about the what as in what am I going to offer my market or in other words what is it that you're selling the key here is to Define and clarify exactly what you do and make sure to choose an offer that's going to help you maximize your enjoyment and profitability all at the same time by keeping your focus squarely on your most important most relevant and highest value offer you avoid confusing and overwhelming people the fact is that confus confused customers and Confused clients don't buy so keep the focus on a single offer one at a time and keep it clean clear and as simple as possible okay next up Market the market is all about the who as in who is my ideal customer Avatar or ideal client Avatar my perfect target market the kinds of people that are the best fit for what I have to sell the fact is you can't sell to everyone and the more clear and specific you are the more desirable your offer and your messaging are going to be more on this later though then once you've got that done it's time to move on to the next step the message the message is all about the why as in why are they going to care what problem is my offer helping them solve and why would they want to work with me instead of my competitors now if you've never thought of this before these are some tough questions to answer but fortunately for you you've already done the hard work of identifying your model and your market so now all you really need to do is kind of bridge the gap between the two first identify what I call your ideal clients Miracles and miseries their miracles are all of their wants and needs and dreams and goals and desires their miseries on the other hand are all of their pains and problems and fears and frustrations your offer job the model in this case is to help them move away from their miseries and towards their miracles and your message is how you're going to help communicate how you do that okay next up media media is all about the where and when as in where is your market present and active online and offline what media types and platforms do they prefer and how are you going to reach them for example through text or audio or video not to mention when and how often you're going to post or create content there which is all about your content frequency and schedule now most people mistakenly start here first hearing about how Tik Tok is the place to be or how Instagram reals are getting an extra push from the algorithm or how YouTube is perhaps the single greatest marketing opportunity of our entire generation and as true as these things are objectively they may not be true or at least they may not be the best fit for you your business and your audience after all as great as YouTube is if the thought of creating long form videos just doesn't work with you right now then you're going to want to pass or if your business happens to serve an older demographic then Tik Tok probably isn't the best place for you if you serve mostly men then you can probably safely ignore Pinterest at least for now and if you serve an international audience there's even more considerations with different social media sites being blocked or banned or Limited in different countries the point is you've got to find out where your ideal target market is active and present and then go there ignoring everything else now being in the right place at the right time is a good start but it's not enough to create profitable campaigns for that you also need a machine so let me walk you through that next the machine is all about the how as in how will I guide my target market through the process to becoming a paying customer or client in marketing we call this a marketing funnel or a sales funnel or a customer Journey but the machine is a really important topic so I'm going to walk you through it in more detail later in this video the next thing then that we need to talk about before that is the social media algorithms but first I want to tell you about this report right here you see HubSpot recently came out with their value packed and completely free social media trends report to help you create a winning social media strategy by giving you an exclusive look into how people engage across social both personally and professionally for example if you're curious about how AI is disrupting marketing then you'll be interested to hear that 71% of social media marketers are now using AI tools and how that 87% of Market believe that using AI tools is crucial to a successful social media strategy this year another popular topic and Trend taking over right now is community building and 86% of social media marketers say building an active online community is crucial to a successful social media strategy now that customers and consumers are expecting more engagement and support on social media than ever before there's also insights on the increased use of social for research the impact of social media shopping and an expert panel with insights from other social media thought leaders and the best part is it's completely free so make sure to click the link down in the descriptions below this video to download your free copy of hubspot's social media trends report today now let's dive into the algorithms and how to use them to your advantage as fancy and complicated as the social media algorithms might sound well they're actually pretty straightforward so if your social media accounts and following aren't growing as fast as you were hoping or your content isn't getting the reach you expected it's usually just because the algorithm is having having a hard time doing its job of matching your content up with the Right audience but don't worry because once you know what the algorithm is looking for you can simply follow the rest of the tips that I'm giving you here in this video in order to make the algorithms work to your advantage you see the algorithm only has two jobs number one to find content for people that they might enjoy and then number two to show them as much of this enjoyable content as possible so that they stay on the platform forever so the secret then is to help the algorithm by being crystal clear about who your account is for and then optimizing your content for your fans your followers and your audience because if they like it and so will the algorithm but we'll talk more about attracting your ideal audience shortly another Cliffhanger there for you for now what's important to know is that when it comes to content types there is still one kind of social media content that Reigns Supreme and that will get you more reach more views more clicks than pretty much any other kind of content video so let's talk about that now it's no longer a secret that your clients your customers and your audience want more video content the social media platforms all want more video and most of the content online is now video based yes Tex still works blogs are still a thing and yes podcasting still works maybe even better now than ever before as it's become more mainstream and popular but none of those come close to video in regards to both popularity and Effectiveness After All video allows you to see and to hear someone and with the right kind of captions you can keep people engaged by allowing them to read parts of what you're saying as well and as for building trust and becoming an authority in your industry video is still the next best thing to being in person face to face and it builds trust like nothing else out there allowing you to communicate a ton of value very quickly now when it comes to video there's a ton of different things that you can do depending on your experience and your comfort level and your budget of both time and money the easiest way to get started is to just grab your phone and shoot a quick 15 or 30 second or so story and post it on Instagram it's fast it's simple it's low barrier to entry and it's a great way to show your more personal side with without needing to edit or put in any kind of post- production in fact inside our agency accelerator program where we help people start and scale successful marketing agencies one of the first kind of content that we have our students create is short 30 second stories which provide one of the biggest bangs for your marketing buck in regards to the effort versus reward and ability to generate New Leads new clients and new sales to take it to the next level creating a slightly more polished Facebook or Instagram re a Tik Tok or a YouTube short is going to be worth your time of course this then leads us to the next piece of the puzzle what kind of video is best short form long form one of the biggest questions that people are asking right now is all about the pros and cons of long form content versus short form content to keep things simple we're going to call short form content any kind of vertical content that's 1 to 3 minutes or less something like a short a story or a real and we'll call long form content any kind of horizontal content that's 5 to 10 minutes or longer think of a regular length YouTube video a podcast maybe even a long form blog post now I'm just going to come right out and say it for most people most of the time long form content is a better and more profitable bet to make first off let's talk about the depth you can achieve with long form content because when you're creating longer pieces longer videos or longer form articles of a thousand words or more well you've got space to really dig into a topic which means you can provide more insights and data and Analysis that kind of stuff that short form just can't match not only does this help in form your audience but it also positions you as an authority in your field and when people find your content informative and valuable guess what they start trusting you more and coming back for more longer form content also tends to rank higher in the search engines as they usually include more keywords and backlinks and social shares plus longer content keeps readers or viewers on your page or video longer reducing balance rates and increasing dwell time all these fancy nerdy marketer words that basically just send positive signals to the search engines boosting your site or your videos visibility and helping drive more traffic plus long form content tends to get more shares on social media when viewers or readers find your content valuable and engaging they're more likely to share it with their networks this not only increases your reach but also enhances your Brand's visibility and credibility and more shares mean more eyes on your content that's a win-win let's not forget about user experience providing a thorough well researched piece of content means you're answering your audien's questions and addressing their pain points at a much deeper level when users find all of the info that they need in one place they're more satisfied more likely to return and from a business perspective long form content can be an absolute power host for lead generation whether you're making detailed guides or white papers long form videos or webinars well they often require your audience to provide their contact information in order to access the content this helps to build your email list and identifies potential leads who are genuinely interested in your offers plus long form content can nurture these leads by providing them with valuable information that moves them through the sales funnel further Boos in conversion rates even higher finally as if this wasn't enough already one of my favorite benefits of long form content is its longevity essentially by focusing on creating Evergreen content stuff that remains relevant over time can keep attracting traffic and generating leads long after it's published plus you can also repurpose long form content into various other formats like blog posts and social media updates and videos and podcasts and infographics all of this helps to maximize your content marketing efforts and helps you reach a bigger audience at a deeper level long story short bit of a pun there for you while short form content is quick and easy to consume the benefits of long form content far outweigh the extra time and energy required for this strategy to pay off big time that said the next question we need to answer then is when it comes to making this content what's more important quality or quantity if you've ever read a blog post or listened to a podcast or seen a video on content marketing then I know you've come across the age-old advice to publish highquality content content on a consistent basis everyone says this even me and they're not wrong quality content on a consistent basis is one of the biggest keys to success in marketing but it's the end point not the start quality content isn't something that just happens right out of the gate takes practice engaging with your audience and slowly building up your content creation skills and so the advice to focus on creating the highest quality content you possibly can often causes people to give up before they even really get going to agonize over their content and to judge it way too harshly and in the end well this basically just leads to them never doing anything for fear of how they or their content might be perceived but the reality is that in this hyper competitive market more is better different is better and better may not actually be better because quality is subjective so what looks terrible to you might look amazing to someone else and probably does so if you're currently putting out one video a month try to make it weekly if you're sending out a weekly marketing email try three times a week try to make it daily and if you're putting out daily Instagram cont content well could you try it twice a day I bet you could you see it's competitive out there my friend so the key is to do your best and do it as often as you can without going crazy in the process that's the game that's the fun ultimately the best kind of content to post is the kind that's going to give your audience the most value which is what this next point is all about as we already covered when we talked about the marketing master plan one of the very first steps in any marketing campaign is first identifying and clarifying exactly who it is and what kind of client lead or Prospect you want to generate because the truth is that anyone can generate leads thousands even millions of them for example if I wanted to generate a thousand New Leads right now well I could run a sweep Stakes or a draw just give away a free iPad if I wanted to generate a million New Leads I could give away a car but all that's going to do is get me a ton of leads that are probably never going to buy anything and are really just here for the free iPad or free car so the best way to do this is to take a look at your current Client List and then do a simple 8020 analysis on on them in other words taking all 100% of your clients current and former and then identifying who the top 20% of them are typically you'll want to rank them in regards to revenue but you could also factor in other things like how enjoyable these clients are to work with how many referrals they send you how easy is it for you to make them happy and deliver your products or Services if on the other hand you're launching a brand new offer or starting a brand new business and you don't have any previous customers to look through you're going to need to get a little more creative and start having conversations with potential clients and potential buyers who you think would be a good fit in order to get the following information information that falls into three different categories the first category you want to Define is their demographic details these are things like their age and gender income and occupation next is their Geographic details like what city state Province or country they live in and then lastly is their psychographic details like what are their interests their Lifestyles their Hobbies any groups or organizations or affiliations they're a part of what are their behaviors you things like that in marketing when you put these all together you get what's often referred to as an IC or ideal customer Avatar and knowing this and truly trying to understand your customers and your clients better than they even know themselves is what separates the amateur marketers from the pros that and having a really solid funnel so let's talk about that now when it comes to marketing funnels there are a ton of different shapes and sizes out there but the one I want to share with you today is the one I use pretty much 90% of the time and I call it the case funnel the case funnel is a marketing funnel designed to take your prospect from having no idea who you are all the way through to becoming a lifelong loyal paying client and it's perfect if you sell your services through a sales call the case stands for coaches and Consultants agencies service professionals and experts the funnel helps to pre-qualify clients overcome objections in advance and really just makes the entire client acquisition and sales process faster easier and more efficient and it looks like this so let me walk you through it now starting with traffic every marketing funnel starts with some kind of traffic this could be a social media post a blog a podcast a video an ad doesn't matter the key here though is to drive the traffic to the next step of the funnel which is the optim page if you're dealing with cold traffic meaning the people that you're marketing to have never heard of you before then it's important to guide them through the rest of the steps in the order they're presented on the other hand If you're receiving a warm lead something like a referral well then you can safely bypass these first few steps and move them straight to the application page page so I'll talk more about that in just a second for now assuming your lead came from cold traffic well like I said the next step is that opt-in page the opt-in page exists for one reason and one reason alone to get someone to opt in yeah it's pretty profound I know so typically what you want to do here is offer them something of value like a free downloadable training a checklist a video or some kind of cheat sheet in exchange for your prospect's name and email address then once they enter their details and hit submit they're immediately taken to the next stage of the funnel The Authority amplifier it's here in the authority amplifier stage that you want to provide value and establish your credibility and expertise what works best here is to provide a short training video that helps your prospect with a problem that they have now you don't have to give everything away but try to provide a quick win and then follow it up with an invitation to apply to your services by clicking a link somewhere on the page once they click the link to apply well they're then directed to an application form which is the next step of the funnel having an application form for your services is one of the the most valuable things that you can do in that it not only helps you get more information on your potential clients and how you might possibly be able to help them but it also sets the frame and shows that you are an expert and you're not necessarily willing to work with just anyone who pays you this is important for both cold traffic and warm traffic yes even your best referrals who come from your best clients should still be requested to fill out an application prior to a call as it again helps to collect valuable information and also sets the tone that you're not willing to work with just anybody who comes your way now you can review each application manually or you can leverage automation as most online form software allows you to redirect them to the next page automatically if the application looks good or redirect them somewhere else if it looks not so good and the next page is the calendar booking page here in the calendar booking stage you can allow your prospect to choose from one of your available times in order to have a quick call with you to go over their application to discuss their goals and decide together on whether or not you're a good fit to work together so that's the case funnel and if you're looking for for even more strategies well I've got a video linked up right here with 10 more proven and profitable marketing strategies that are guaranteed to grow any business so make sure to tap or click that now and I'll see you in there in just a second
1WTD-V2F_N8,How to create a stand-out SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY for your small business + how to film & edit videos,Unknown,182444,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1WTD-V2F_N8/hq720.jpg,2024-07-02 00:00:00,1524,Chantal Leonhardt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WTD-V2F_N8,I recently grew my Instagram from 25 to 100K in just over a month and I broke every social media rule to do it so you're probably thinking Chantel how well let me tell you this I don't post 5 to 7 second videos in fact majority of my content is over a minute long I don't worry about using trending audios and this is the Shocker right I most definitely do not post consistently maybe once a week so what then sh how well let's get a different perspective it's not the how but the why because before we talk about the how we need to figure out the why why are you even creating content why are you on this app because let me tell you it's not the social media strategy it's your social media strategy so let's Dive Right In hey guys welcome back to my Channel or welcome to my channel if you're new here my name's Chantel I'm a color artist and illustrator who is sharing her journey about creating her children's book online and today we are going to create your social media strategy because it is something that is so important if you want to grow a community if you want to grow on the online space and actually reach your destination and your goals and this information is something that I would have killed to have at the beginning of my journey when I started posting on social media in February 2022 however I had no idea what I was doing and I struggled to find this information online especially because the social media gurus the people that are in the space that have this knowledge love to gatekeep and I thought I would come on here and share it with you guys and you might say Chantel what is your credentials what is your knowledge well I started posting on social media yeah February 2022 and my videos on Tik Tok and Instagram would only reach a few hundred people and when I look at other creators that kind of share their knowledge online about having a social media strategy or how to film and edit uh videos for Tik Tok and Instagram they blew up from the get-go and I'm like why would I trust your knowledge I can't relate to you at all so I've really come from a place where I knew nothing and I have grown into a space where I have recently found my content style and I've accumulated so much understanding in the space particularly to the art and creative community and I want to share it with you guys because as I said as as much value I can give to other people and help their Journey inspires my own so I'm going to share with you the four chapters in my own social media strategy so you can create your own for your own art business and I'm also going to share a little bit behind the scenes of how I film and edit my videos for Tik Tok and Instagram one more thing I've also created a 25 five page booklet that goes in depth on all the chapters that we're going to go through today with lots more questions lots more advice ideas series all of that is in my 25 page booklet and it's something that I share with my one-on-one sessions that I do with people and I also do social media classes in my local community and people have said to me Shantel this information that you have here needs to be available for everyone like it's so succinct it's so professional put and it's all in one place so everything that you need to know about a social media strategy to reach your goal and it's not hundreds of dollars like every social media strategy course that I ever see which is nuts so it's affordable let's get on to the video I have picked like the worst day to film because the Sun is going all the time but you know what sometimes the energy and the passion behind your video is more important than the quality of it so we're going to continue guys if you're not having purpose behind the brand then why are you creating and what is your goal what is your destination and if you don't have strategy in place then you're never going to achieve your goals on social media so let's get into it what is your personal brand what is your brand identity in one sentence I want you to summarize who you are and why you are creating and that is one of the hardest things to do but is but it is so important because your personal brand is going to underline and back up every video you create and it's so important to have this kind of thesis statement to back up every single post that you do because without it you're not going to have consistency and without consistency you're not going to have an Engaged following so it that is why it is so important so I'm going to share my own kind of brand identity and it can change it over time but it's something that needs to be longterm like longterm in a year in a future something that is going to stay with you for quite a while because it is going to create that consistency so for me mine is Chantal leonart is a watercolor artist and illustrator inspiring you to connect with your inner child and chase your dreams now that is something that is an apparent in every single post that I put on either Tik Tok YouTube or Instagram now after your brand identity and after you've defined yourself who you are and what you are and why you are creating the the social media gurus like to come up with this term they call pillars now every single person that I've watched and seen and heard and listened to has a different definition of pillars but they're mainly like subjects that back up subjects or areas of your brand identity that back up your thesis statement that we just created in that one sentence and your pillars do not have to be in every post that you make they are like making up the content of your posts and your feed so for my pillars I really kind of have I'm a children's book illustrator I'm a watercolor artist and I'm also a studio art gallery owner and that's something that makes up the content I post but it's not apparent in every post that I put up if that makes kind of sense my workbook I kind of go into like a bit more detail on what your purpose is on this app what inspires you fleshing out those juicy questions for you guys to understand how to create your thesis statement and furthermore create your social media goals but for now we're going to go on and move on to the social media goals that you might [Music] have so what is your main goal on social media why are you posting on this platform and especially if you are a small business you are a creative you are a artist you will have very specific social media goals or business goals that can be trans ated into social media goals so I'm going to read some out which wrot in my workbook so maybe your social media goal is to collaborate with brands or companies to sell your art your accommodation to book out your services maybe it's to connect with your audience grow engage relationship with your community really knuckle down on what your social media goal is and perhaps it's a variety of these goals as well so really kind of have a broad term of like sell educate you know collaborate whatever type of social media goal that you have have and then really put into detail um the spec the specifics of that goal maybe the time frame um and what it looks like to you in detail in order to create your social media goals you need to understand who you are creating content for AKA your target audience understand who are they where do they live what are their interests their desires their dreams and when you begin to understand your target audience you're going to understand what type of content you need to create in order to reach them and make them want to stay so here's a few questions you can ask yourself in order to achieve your business AKA your social media goals can your target audience live anywhere in the world do they need to come and visit you in person what are their interests what are their likes and when you answer those questions you're going to begin to form an idea of who you should create content for and when you understand who you are creating content for we can get into the specific F of the posting time the uh captions and hashtags and the algorithm so let's dive into those the number one question I get asked is what about the algorithm should tell and let me tell you right now as soon as someone says algorithm you should start posting for what the algorithm wants you should be flexible and learn the algorithm this is the rubbish bin right and you're going to put that advice in the bin and let me tell you why that is so such advice to kind of follow the algorithm right let me say this very articulately if you are creating content for the algorithm and no longer creating content to achieve your social media goals then why are you creating content in the first place you're doing more harm than good for your overall business and your page like that's crazy and the thing is as well is that the algorithm is constantly changing and so if you're constantly changing your content style and your content form to fit the algorithm people who are following you will have no idea what's going on and the lack of consistency in your page is going to make it's going to lead you to downfall later in the track because you're not going to be able to keep up so everybody that says oh my God algorithms changed to like this form now we should all go do that is absolutely nuts because it's absolutely crazy let me give you a great example I've had people say to me Chantel you need to start like posting 5 to 7c videos because at the moment that is what the algorithm wants and I'm like are you crazy first of all my social media goal is is to get people emotionally invested in my art journey and illustrating my children's book let me tell you right now I cannot do that in a 5 to 7 second video and so posting 5 to 7 second videos even though they might get me exposure if I do it consistently it's not going to achieve my social media goal and in fact it's going to do me more harm than good on my page and for my long-term project of putting my children's book out in the world so you know what that viice absolute trash bag also I love love love love creating content I love storytelling and I think the passion for my content Creation in that style really comes through my work and my most viewed videos that have like millions of views are over a minute long and I'm posting them when supposedly the algorithm is favoring 5 to 7 second videos so the advice that people give you that you should post for the algorithm absolute trash absolute in the bin now don't get me wrong take this advice with a big fat grain of salt because if your social media goals line up with what the algorithm favors at the moment then by all means lucky you um post those 5 to 7 second videos but yeah be careful with like following the advice and following the algorithm because really if you are consistent with any type of content form the algorithm is going to favor you if you keep up that consistency and keep up that engagement so you might be asking yourself the lighting has gone again so you might be asking yourself Shantel how do I even create a social media goal how do I translate a business goal to a social media goal and then take that into a short-term goal and an actionable step [Music] let's get into the most important chapter the chapter that you all have been waiting for which is content creation how do I film and edit videos first of all what is the structure of a good video or a the content creation that we or the content that we want to create usually a video falls into this basic structure it starts with a hook then folds the value of your content and it ends with a CTA which is your call to action now your hook grabs the viewers attention because if they don't feel like they're part of your video or you're going to be offering enough value to come then they're going to scroll away so in the first 3 to 5 Seconds you need to grab the viewers attention otherwise they're gone so a hook can either be written it can be visual or it can be audio and I say if you have all three you've got the golden Tri Vector but depending on your content creation style you might choose one or the other and you might have one that is more engaging then the other two which just back it up after your hook folds the value of your video whatever you want to say and that usually is content that is entertaining or educational or inspiring or it could be a mixture of all three after the um structure of your video or the value that you provide there is your call to action what do you want people to do after they've watched this video and this can even be subconscious it doesn't have to be in your face like buy my book it can be like um even hidden the caption or you know it could be signing up to a mailing list it could be just following along the journey it could be buying a product or a service and it could even be written at the end of the video or said at the end of the video or even in the caption or maybe not even there at all it's just subliminally hinted at it and sometimes that has the best effect as well so let's go into specific types of content creation how these types of content creation feed into your social media goals and allow you to achieve your social media goals because every type of content will have a different outcome so let's get into it now my little workbook has an entire list of all different types of content creation what kind of niches they fall into and their specific outcomes but because I don't want this video to be hours long I'm just going to share a few of them with you guys especially that um creatives or art businesses can use so I'm going to read them out on my computer because like they're quite a long you know so of course you have your day in your life which you know brings people along a journey it gives a little bit of transparency which is great for building trust then we have videos that are usually called one shots because they are just one shot it doesn't have any breaks and they're usually great for making people take immediate action we can also have processes or behind the scenes which kind of show people a little bit more Dimension to your brand of course my favorite is storytelling because this really allows you to kind of have an emotional connection with your viewer and because people buy an emotion not logic this is great if they want to if you want people to like invest in your journey which is what I love to do so let's get into the specifics of how to create great content and I'm going to talk about lighting audio camera equipment and Aesthetics the number one thing is that you need to have great lighting at the moment I don't have great lighting because the clouds are covering up the sun which is really annoying me but I really wanted to film this video so I'm going to continue and see how bad the footage looks and see if I need to refilm it the other thing is that you need good quality audio you need good quality audio before you have good quality um visuals because if the audio is people will leave and so this little microphone that I'm using is not a $200 Road microphone that people have clipped on shirt in fact it's I think a $25 little wired microphone that connects to my iPhone port and I'll link it in my description it's great I use it for doing all my voiceovers um anytime that I need to create a video speaking to you guys you'll see that I have this microphone as well and I just kind of put it up through my shirt so it's not annoying me the other thing is that I film everything on my iPhone and I always use the back camera because the back camera is so much more high quality than the one on the front and yeah I think I have an iPhone 11 Pro so not even that new so your camera can do everything that you ever need you don't need any special camera equipment to film videos like that's crazy and the other thing is I have three different types of tripods you guys are sitting on one of them at the moment which is a concept tripod I've had it for years and honestly it's broken at the moment so you guys is actually like kind of taped to the tripod it's I need to fix it but yeah that camera tripod is my ride or die it fits also my DSLR camera if I need to shoot like high quality um photos for my brand but it's what I use for my camera footage as well the other tripod that I have is this one which is just your $45 one from Amazon I'll link it in my storefront as well but she films all the angles that I need for illustrating my children's book or any painting that I'm doing or any um tutorials that I do on my patreon I can get a pretty much vertical um bird ey view I can get sharp angles and she's pretty small as well the other tripod I also have is this little one that uh moft has just sent me and look how slim and compact it is and it works by um a magnet so I take the case off my iPhone and the magnet of the back of my iPhone stick sticks on the back of the moof tripod and I pretty much use it if I want to get up and close views of little details for my painting or if you want to paint um you know you do a lot of filming in public on the go the last thing is your Aesthetics so because like Instagram is very an aesthetic app you need to have you know no clutter in the background of your video choose a font or two or maybe even more and have them stay consistent throughout your entire content creation because people just love consistency and if you're changing up fonts all the time it's just going to annoy them and it's going to annoy you too so really choose a font and perhaps even a color that suits your theme and stick to it all right so you might be thinking Chantel how on Earth do I even film a video well I'm going to show you my setup and maybe that inspires you how you can set up your own so I have these gorgeous full window that are North facing and I'm on the southern hemisphere so I get beautiful light in my studio practically all year round and recently I've made use of that light by switching my desk around to have it directly facing the Sun and that means I can get even sunlight across all of my artwork so I kind of set my little tripod up on the corner of my desk so that the corner of my room is going to be in the middle of my footage and this just really makes my content just nice nice even in balance and I kind of used like a grid of third so the top third will be kind of the roof where I'm going to put text uh the middle third is kind of me and the F Focus point and the bottom is kind of my artwork and I don't want my artwork to be so far down the bottom that when I post it to Instagram or Tik Tok the caption is going to cover it so I kind of play around with that um shifting my tripod up and down depending on what I am filming I will go and pretend paint for an intro sorry social media is fake don't know who who's going to tell you that um otherwise I just fil me painting in the process as well so that's that's all natural when you the other two ways that I capture content is with this tripod and you can kind of see how I've set it up here and I kind of just put my phone uh on top there and I kind of shift the angles to round and experiment to see what captures my painting best but yeah I definitely find on the left side is better I'm going to show you a few different videos I've taken Here For an upcoming reel next week and you can kind of see how I've experimented with kind of Shifting the angle of the camera up and down in and out and I'm just going to kind of see which video Suits Me best and then I will go into cap cut which is a third party editing app so I can export the video in really high quality footage uh to YouTube shorts Instagram reals and Tik Tok and I'm going to kind of show you how I edit an intro so this is the intro to my third page which no one has seen before and I'm kind of cutting out all the spaces in between the big movements so I really want to capture big movements something that's interesting for the audience and this is example of my second page I quickly edited those movements together and you can kind of see here and you can kind of see here how I've um created a bit of an intro uh that tells people how and why I'm illustrating my children's book and then I go into filming and editing the process of actually illustrating my children book I hope that was really helpful and inspired you guys new ways you could film and edit your own content so now you know your personal brand you have your social media goals and you know how to create great content so how do you actually create a community of people that are are invested in what you do and how do you get exposure and go viral well let's dive in we want to nurture the community that we have and provide value to the audience and our little family you guys that are supporting my work so how do you do that and there are three things the number one thing of creating a community is being transparent in your work transparency creates trust and it creates people that love you because you're sharing knowledge that they don't have number two is consistency being consistent in your art style in your content style in your business style and that consistency is going to to remind people who you are what your brand identity is and why you are creating number three is involvement your actual involvement with your community replying to comments replying to DMS replying to emails liking people's comments stories taking people behind the scenes having little polls having a broadcast channel you know having little secrets between your really good fans and you know making people invested in what you do so that's kind of how those three things kind of build your community oh my God I am out of breath anyway guys of course when I finish talking the Sun is going to come out but I just want to say I just want to say before I love and leave you guys thank you so so much for watching I hope that this has shown you another side to social media strategy and you can take a lot of things back to the world book I hope this video was educational entertaining and inspiring and I hope you

L7mcHxcUnM4,Build Your Brand in 30 Days | Best Social Media Marketing Strategy for Entrepreneurs,Unknown,112021,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L7mcHxcUnM4/hq720.jpg,2020-03-24 00:00:00,1437,Marley Jaxx,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7mcHxcUnM4,"(bright music) - I don't know about you but when I have this
awesome business idea, I want it done yesterday. So in this video, I put together a plan for how to build your brand in 30 days. I'm gonna give you the
step-by-step, the day-by-day, every single thing you
have to accomplish each day over the next 30 days. I'm giving you the best social
media marketing practices for entrepreneurs so you can achieve this. And actually, before we get into it, I've actually broken it down, you can click the link below where I break down each day, each goal, so you can accomplish
building out your brand in the next 30 days. Let's go. I've broken this down into three phases. There's lead generation, lead
nurture, and lead conversion. So that's about 10 days for each section. Some sections might be
heavier than others, depending on where you're at in your business model currently. So the first thing, first
day, before anything, before you can build a brand and have something to sell to people, you need to know who those people are. So day one is about developing
your audience and your niche. Who are you actually serving? Who are you talking to? Who do you wanna help and
provide and serve in this world? Who are those people? And what do they want? What do they need? What keeps them up at night? What's the solution that you
provide to their problems? There's this concept called
Red Ocean Blue Ocean, and that means in the world of marketing or the world of products and services, the Red Ocean is a space
where it's quite competitive, and it's called Red Ocean because there's this imagery of sharks and really eating each
other and competing, that these waters become so bloodied. Then, there's the Blue Ocean where it's this bright Blue Ocean, it's yours for the taking. However, in that Blue Ocean,
it's so open that potentially, you might not have customers there. There's tons of customers
in the Red Ocean, but that's where the
content or the category king might be the one who is
winning in that space, and there's so many competitors
and an audience there. And the Blue Ocean is where, like I said, it might be such a new opportunity that your audience isn't there yet. It might take more capital and building before you can really establish
yourself in that space. We wanna find the
in-between, the Purple Ocean, 'cause the Red Ocean is where
it's very highly-competitive, but there's an audience there. So how can you take that niche and find a sub-niche from it, that you take what you know is popular but create something that's
a little bit of a tangent off so that you create this
whole new opportunity? And this is where your brand can excel is if you can take a new opportunity, something that people already
have but show them a new way. For example, Blockbuster. People loved Blockbuster. Going to the Blockbuster stores and be able to pick a movie,
rent it, bring it back, instead of going to the movie
theater or buying movies, but Netflix created a new opportunity where it was movies on-demand, wherever you are from any device. And unfortunately, Blockbuster and all the
other movie rental places that were in a Red Ocean
at the time are no longer. The next step in the first 10 days after you figured out who's
the audience you wanna serve is how do you wanna serve them? Let's develop your offer. This is your product or service. This is the new opportunity, the opportunity switch
that you bring to them. Like I mentioned, there was Blockbuster. They were in this very competitive niche, and Netflix created a new opportunity, total opportunity switch that instead of people
having to leave their house, get in the car, drive to Blockbuster, they could, through a
remote, pick any movie anytime that they wanna watch anywhere. And now, yes, there are
other competitors to Netflix. There's Amazon Prime, there's Hulu, there's so many that I
can't even think to name, but Netflix has this first-mover advantage and they were able to create
their name in the space first. But then for anyone
new who comes in there, now that's where it's gonna
get more competitive for them even though Netflix is the category king. So think of it this way when
you're creating your offer is how can you create something that's totally different
for your audience, something that gives you
the first-mover advantage, and is something that your audience
completely, totally wants. And the biggest way,
the best way to do this is to listen to what
does an audience want. Find a warm audience,
find out what they want, and then give it to them. And as we're creating an offer,
I want you to think ahead, not just one product or service. How can you actually
create a value ladder? And I actually have a
whole video on my channel about how we created our value ladder. And this is where you have an audience that you can ascend to them through different levels
of value and price points to be able to work with you through your products or services. Think of it like this:
someone could buy my book, which is, I don't know, 10, $20. That's an entry-level way
that they can get access to me with a low investment of time and money. Then, as they begin to
know, like, and trust me, then maybe they wanna
buy my course for $200. And then after that, they have more of a relationship with me that I've been able to provide
them value through my book, and through my course that now
they want maybe the next step which is maybe a live event. They wanna meet me in person, they wanna come attend
and be in this group, in this community, and spend more time and
learn more in-depth. So they are now willing to
invest more time and resources into a higher level of that value ladder. And after you've ascend
them through there, maybe you have a very high-ticket offer where they wanna pay
you thousands of dollars for a mentorship program or
marketing, a coaching program. See how we started from the
beginning of the value ladder all the way up to the top, and through that, we
were able to ascend them because you have built this
know, like, and trust factor, and they actually feel more comfortable, and yes, I will give you
my hard-earned money, and I will hold up my credit
card to anything you offer me because I know the value
that I'm gonna get in return. And it doesn't just have to be a book, an online course, an event. That was just an example
of my value ladder. But a value ladder can even be someone coming in for a haircut and then signing them up
for a subscription model where they come in to get
their hair done every month. It can be McDonald's saying,
do you want fries with that, that they go from just the
burger to the whole combo. There's lots of different ways that you can create a value ladder, and go check out the video on my channel that tells you all about
how we created ours. The next step within the
lead generation phase is actually building
your branding identity. And know that this whole video
is about building your brand, but building your brand is
more than just about your fonts and your colors and your logo. It's also about your messaging and how and who you offer
your products and services to. So yes, building your brand identity, this is a step that I bring
in after we've already learned who we wanna speak to and
how we wanna serve them. So when it comes to building
your brand identity, yeah, let's look at building a logo, and your fonts, and your colors, how you wanna be portrayed to the world. And just as a disclaimer, this is something that people
get really caught up in and I don't want you to. You don't have to spend
months, weeks, days, years figuring out what your
logo is gonna look like. And this is actually something that a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck in, and I feel like is because they're
battling imposter syndrome, or they're building up their own sabotage. They're self-sabotaging so
they don't do the real work that's gonna get them the biggest results. So when it comes to building your logo, your branding, your
colors, everything else, don't spend too much time on this. You can outsource this, you can hire someone to
support you with this, but also know you don't have to spend a ton of money on this. This can be something that you build on your own using Canva. Canva's one of my favorite
graphic design softwares. It comes with a ton of templates and even color palettes that
work really well together that you can use exactly what
they show you through Canva, and I also have a link that I'll put in the description below to a Canva tutorial video
that I have on my channel that will help you with building out your brand through Canva. You can also outsource
this using Fiverr or Upwork and get support for a low cost. You have your audience, you have your offer
with your value ladder, and now you have your brand identity. So now, it's time to start
building your online presence. This is probably around day five or six if you want to continue
in this 30-day sequence. And disclaimer, you do not have to do this as quick as 30 days. Some things might take
you longer than others. But after you have those
three things in place, now you can start getting online and sharing your message to the masses. Messaging is a really big part
of your brand identity too is how do you wanna speak to your audience? What's your message? How do you actually impact the world? And you can actually look at
so many influencers out there and see what is their messaging? What do they talk about? Gary Vaynerchuk, for example,
he speaks a lot about hustle, and about hard work, and about patience, and about who you need
to be as an entrepreneur to achieve what you wanna achieve. In his messaging, he's also a little bit
rough around the edges, drops some F-bombs, swears, and then there's people
like Arianna Huffington that her message is a lot about self-care as an entrepreneur. She still talks about hard work, but she comes from a different angle, and a lot of her messaging, the way that she speaks
is a lot more softer. So if you compare those two people who are big, big
influencers in this space, they have a different
way of relaying a message to the same audience so consider how you wanna
relate to your audience, how you wanna say it, how
you wanna come across, and to be consistent with that 'cause you might also
see those influencers, those entrepreneurs that you watch that they are all over the place. That one day, they're saying this, and one day, they're saying this. And sometimes, you watch them and think, whoa, what's going on? Is this a hot mess of a person? When that's the thought that's taking away from their actual message, it's hard to know, like, and trust them and buy what they're offering. So think of how you wanna
be portrayed to the world and see how other people are doing it that you can learn from. Next is also creating your strategy for how you want to reach your audience. What platforms do you wanna be on? Are you gonna be on all
social media platforms, or will you focus on a few? So this is a good thing to ask yourself, depending on your audience. Is your audience on LinkedIn? Or are they on Facebook? Or are they on Instagram? Are they on Pinterest? Are they on all of the above? Where do you need to go
to reach your audience? And you don't have to be on all platforms. If you wanna just focus on the few that you're really good at, spend your time there. Focus there. Next is, do you need a website, or do you just need some sales funnels which is the next big
part that actually moves into some of the lead
nurture and lead conversion. So I talked about how we're
breaking this into three phases, but when it comes to your
offer and your sales funnels, these are gonna work in all phases and are really important
for actually selling what it is that you have to offer. So in this part of lead generation, let's talk about creating the strategy for how you're going
to build your audience and own your audience. 'Cause here's the thing is if someone follows you
on Facebook or Instagram or even just lands on your
website, even if you post there, it doesn't mean that
everyone that follows you is going to see it. If I post something on Facebook, it's not gonna reach all
10,000 people or whatever who are following me. I have to actually send it
to them in a different way that I know is going to land. And I could post on all the
different social media platforms and hope that they see it somewhere. But if I have their email, I know that I can send them an email that it will land in their inbox, and now it's also up to me to write a good enough subject line and build the relationship enough that they wanna continue
opening that email, or else, it can easily just
go into the junk folder, or they hit delete
before they even open it and my message gets stuck. But how do I get them to
sign up for my email list and want that to build
that relationship with me in the first place? What I recommend is
building an opt-in funnel. And I'm actually gonna
give you my template for all of my opt-in funnels that we use. You can click the link
below to download that. We use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is my favorite software and has changed my business because of the capabilities
that it gives me to grow my audience, to give value, and then to convert them as a customer. So what this does is if you
can offer something for free, so let's say if you are
a home decor designer. Interior designer, is
that what they're called? If you're an interior designer and you wanna give your top tips for how to dress your window coverings, and that's something that
your audience really wants, so you can maybe give a PDF
or a guide or a checklist or even a video series,
something that's automated that doesn't require you to
be continuously doing this, that they can sign up,
they click the link below, and they're able to get that. They go to your landing page and the landing page tells
'em exactly what it is that you've just promised. It's like here's my top 10 design tips for your window coverings. You can come up with anything. It can even be a coupon code. It can be a live or an automated webinar. It can be a video series. There's lots of different ways that you can provide this value and then get their email
address in exchange. So they go to the page, they see all the copy that
makes them really intrigued for why they want to get this free thing, and they put in their email address. Voila, you now have their email address and they now have your freebie. The next thing you're gonna have to do is to make this automated is sign up for an email
marketing software. We use ActiveCampaign. There's other ones like
AWeber, Infusionsoft Mailchimp, whatever you wanna use. We personally love ActiveCampaign that I'll include a link for that you can get a free trial
if you wanna try it out. And this way, people, when
they sign up for that email, or they sign up for that free thing, it automatically sends it to them, 'cause if you had to
do that over and over, my goodness, that would
take up a lot of your time. And we're trying to build your brand fast so that you can keep growing and not so you get stuck in the tactical. Last step in the lead generation phase, before we moved into
the next 10 to 20 days with lead nurture is your
social media content. We wanna be building relationships. And we call it social
media for a reason, right? Because it's social. If you just wanna have
a one-way conversation, you may as well get a newspaper. But this is a relationship
so post on your social media and have a good variety of content, whether it's 80% value content where you're just building relationships, and make sure you're
responding to those comments and going back and forth,
building that report. And then, 20% of it can be promotional or can be call to action, and get them to go to another thing where they can sign up for
an offer that you have, or a course, or a lead magnet, the freebie thing that you've created. Consider what kind of
content you wanna post or do you want videos,
images, Facebook Live, Instagram Stories, all of the above. How are you going to promote
what you have to your audience and build that relationship? And consider this, before
you go right in with, hey, I have this course
and you should buy it, ask yourself how you've
built that relationship. And consider this: it's kind of like if I were to
go up to a stranger and say, hey, will you marry me? I haven't dated them yet, I haven't taken them out to dinner, I haven't met their parents. So it would be very likely
that they would say, who are you? No. So don't go right in for marriage, don't go right in for the kiss, and don't even offer anything until you've built the relationship, and that you've given them enough value that there is a level of reciprocity that when you do offer that, they go, yes, I do trust you enough to give you my email address
or to give you my credit card and say yes, I wanna work with you, or I want that next step with you. All right, now, we're 10 days in. And remember, you can do
this at your own pace, but typically, in the first 10 days, that's where you can create the audience you wanna work with, the offer you wanna give to them, figure out how you're going to build that relationship with them, what kinda freebies can you offer, how can you build this opt-in funnel on ClickFunnels or whatever
software you wanna use that they can then sign
up for your email list. And from there, because
we have their email and we have these people that we're growing relationships with and attracting more of a cold audience, warming them up to become a warm audience, and then likely, a hot audience that then they want to
buy and work with you for everything that you
offer in the future. So once we have then, now we move into the lead nurture phase where we want to continue to
nurture those relationships. And as you're nurturing, know that because you're building relationships with other people, they're gonna then be able to refer you or to speak volumes about
the offer that you have and be able to draw in more
people to work with you. So continue with your
social media content, but now let's also look
at your email marketing. So you've had these people that have signed up for your list, that they've gotten that free thing, now how do we nurture them further? Are you gonna send weekly newsletters? Maybe you create a weekly newsletter email where you're sharing your stories and what's going on with you that week, or giving them more value. Maybe you give them an
email nurturing sequence that as soon as they've
signed up for that free thing, there's a sequence every day after that where you're sharing your origin story, you're sharing your epiphanies, you're sharing everything
that created who you are today because it's very likely
that people are following you because they see you and they see hope. They see opportunity that
you're the after picture and they're the before picture, and they see, I wanna be like that. How did they get to where they are? And how can I follow in their
footsteps, learn from them, so I can become what they are too? Within day 10 to 20, this is where I also want
you building more funnels. Can you create more opt-ins, more lead generation opportunities where you can give them free things so that you have a variety of different things you can provide them. However, I don't want you blindly just creating a whole bunch of free stuff. I want you to consider how this leads in to your value ladder. Remember we talked about having something from entry-level to high-ticket that they can ascend through all levels. So if you create a book on something and you give them a free,
maybe it's an eBook, maybe it's a guide, maybe it's a checklist or a video series, can you then, after that opt-in, they get that free thing, instead of the next page
just saying, hey, thank you, congratulations, it's on its way, what you can also do is go,
hey, and since you got that, I actually have another small video
series for you that's $27, something that's a pretty low
ticket that isn't a hard way, a hard thing for them, or a big objection for them to say, hey, yeah, I'll raise my credit
card and give you that money because I see the value in
this free thing you gave me, so you've now built the
know, like, trust factor, that now they're willing to invest $27, or really, it can be
anything under about $100, depending on the value
you're gonna provide, and they're willing to
become a customer of yours. Now, before you go too far into creating all these lead
magnets and low-ticket offers, I actually want you to
focus on the higher ticket, your core offer, and your high-ticket ways that people can work with you because your business
is going to thrive more when you actually have an offer
that people want to be in, and that you can sell that, and then build out more
of these front-ends that will ascend them into there. So consider this, if you had
a course or a coaching program where people paid $1,000 to work with you, that would be a pretty
great runaway, right? It would be great revenue, you hopefully make a
good profit from that, and from that, you're
able to support yourself, your family, your business, and reinvest so that maybe you can run
Facebook ads in the future. This isn't even part of the 30-day phase, but you wanna be able to create an offer that gives you the runway so that you can reinvest and
build more into your business, whether that means you
need to hire an assistant or need to hire graphic
design or video editors or some sort of support so you're not doing it all on your own. If all you're doing is selling
these low-ticket things that are less than $100, you're gonna need a big audience to be able to fulfill that for you so that you have profit and money you're able to reinvest into growing your business. So although, yes, I want
you to have some freebies that will bring in an
audience, that's a minor thing 'cause we want to nurture our audience and convert them with our main services, our products or services
that people can buy, and then ascend into a higher ticket, but then have people that
are at the entry level that want to be in your main core offer. So now, we're moving in to day 20 to 30 which is focused on lead conversion. So to recap, lead
generation, date one to 10, we're looking at your
audience, your offer, and who you're speaking to on
which social media platforms and getting them onto your
email list through free offers. Day 10 to 20 is where
we're nurturing them more through video content, Facebook
Lives, Instagram Stories, whatever platforms you wanna focus on, and build up that audience. You're offering them your freebies, getting them onto your email list, you're nurturing them
through your origin story, sharing your epiphanies, giving them more value that makes them feel connected to you, and then figuring out what's your actual core
offer and high ticket that you wanna sell them into
so that you have more runway and you have a way that
you can serve your audience at the best and highest level to give them the results that they want. That's what they're coming
here to see you for, right? Then moving in to lead conversion is we have the offer that we
want to sell our audience into. How do we nurture them enough to then convert them into
wanting to work with us? One of the first things
is getting really clear on what your audience wants. There's a lot of value
for you as a business in hearing what your customers are saying. Example, McDonald's. They had a lot of
customers who were saying, dang, I wish that McDonald's
didn't end at 10 a.m. I don't get up at that time. So not only did they extend
breakfast till 11 a.m., they actually moved it to
being an all-day breakfast, and now they have more people who are wanting to buy those hash browns and those Sausage McMuffins
at all hours of the day, and they did that because they listened to what their audience wanted and now have a higher market share, and now, they're the ones that have the first-mover advantage 'cause now we see other stores, other restaurants that are
creating this all-day breakfast after McDonald's did. After you know what your audience wants and you've created the offer
for what you can give to them is to actually get them
through to now purchase. And is that through just sending them a link to an order form, to, hey, here's the course or the event or the product that I have to sell and here's how you buy it. You can create that through an easy sales
funnel on ClickFunnels which I'll also give you a link for if you click the link below to get that. You can download it right
into your ClickFunnels account and use exactly that, you can
send them to an order form, or maybe you wanna get
on the phone with them and have an application call, or have a strategy call with them to show them what it is that you offer. Can they get on a call with you and you build that relationship and you show them what
it is you have to offer. That's another great way
of converting your audience from just being an audience
to now being a customer is typically through an order
form, get them on the phone, or show them exactly how they can sign up. Lastly in lead conversion is
to always look at your numbers, and this is gonna be a continuous thing. And as you're going
through lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion, you're always gonna be
going through this cycle. You always wanna be generating leads, filling your pipeline so you
can then fulfill your pipeline after you've converted them. There's a lot of real estate
agents that get stuck in this where they're selling so many houses and then after those deals are done, they have to hustle to find new customers. Or if they had lead
generation always in place, they would just always have this flow of new customers in and out, always going. You don't wanna be in
this feast or famine. You wanna always have customers coming in. So one of the most important
things is to know your numbers. How can you know what's
working and optimize from there if you don't know your numbers? So look at your social media engagement. Look at your follower
count if it's growing. Look at your conversion
rates, your opt-in rates, your click-through rates on your funnels, on your if you're running Facebook Ads which you don't have to do
within these first 30 days, but look and see what's
working and what's not. You can also look at even your videos, if you're creating video content and just see how long are
people actually watching. Are they watching for 30
seconds and then leaving? What did I say at 30 seconds? Or did they just get bored? What can I do to make things, to make my content and
make all of my offers the most optimized for my customers so that my audience then
becomes paying customers? Don't just base it on
what you think you want, you have to listen to
what your audience wants which is the biggest theme for this is to create based on
an audience that's warm, and find out what they want, and then give them what they want. So you can follow this whole
plan for the next 30 days. You can do is over and over. It doesn't have to be just in the 30 days. Even if you have a brand
that's pretty established, a lot of these things can
continue to grow your brand, and I've outlined everything step-by-step. If you click the link below, it actually gives you more
details and resources and tools and things you can download along the way. Don't forget, I had a ton
of videos that I reference that you can check out about Canva, about building your value ladder, tons of other stuff on my
channel that you can see. And if you do have any questions, I would love for you to comment below so that I can support you
with building your brand. It can especially be tricky when it comes to what are my offers? How do I build up my value ladder? And that's something
that I really love to do and I'm really good at so comment below if

RmwI_QqcPQc,How To Market Your Business On Social Media,Unknown,2205498,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmwI_QqcPQc/hq720.jpg,2021-04-20 00:00:00,725,Marley Jaxx,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmwI_QqcPQc,"If you want more eyes on your business and moreÂ 
sales in your bank account social media marketingÂ Â  is the way to go. In this video, let's talk aboutÂ 
how to market your business on social media. Here's the thing, I want to let you in on aÂ 
big secret. There are three main objectivesÂ Â  to keep in mind with marketing your businessÂ 
on social media and if you don't have thisÂ Â  then your strategy is broken. Then I'm going toÂ 
share with you three proven tactics for landingÂ Â  clients, growing your business, getting clientsÂ 
that even you love to work with and that loveÂ Â  to pay you. What are the objectives of social mediaÂ 
marketing? I am so glad you asked, there's three ofÂ them.Â  You ready for it? Lead generation, lead nurtureÂ 
and lead conversion. If you don't have thoseÂ Â  then your business is broken, and you're justÂ 
creating content for the sake of content, andÂ Â  you're going to keep running on this hamsterÂ 
wheel, and you and your business deserve wayÂ Â  more than that. Every single piece of content youÂ 
create to market your business on social mediaÂ Â  should be reaching and accomplishing one of theseÂ 
three or all of these three. Lead generation, leadÂ Â  nurture, and lead conversion. Every single pieceÂ 
of content should be reverse engineering what itÂ Â  is that you have to sell and how is that piece ofÂ 
content either generating, nurturing or converting.Â  Sometimes they can even be leading to all three.Â 
For example, I might have a post where I'm tellingÂ Â  a story about a strategy that I use that changedÂ 
my life, that changed my business, that helped meÂ Â  to make more money and I could say, ""Click the linkÂ 
below to get access to this thing. I'm going toÂ Â  give it to you for free today."" That post, that pieceÂ 
of content, because it has a strong call to actionÂ Â  is going to generate a lead. Because they can clickÂ 
through that call to action and they can joinÂ Â  my email list. Which then, they are going toÂ 
be nurtured. But even if I back up to thatÂ Â  post itself where I'm telling a reallyÂ 
engaging story that I've created it withÂ Â  the strategy in mind. That I want to give themÂ 
this epiphany, that they walk away with thinking,Â Â  ""That's the way that I can now also get thisÂ 
result."" It's nurturing them before I've evenÂ Â  generated that lead and then the conversion comesÂ 
on the back end after they've opted into my emailÂ Â  list and maybe I have a nurturing email sequenceÂ 
that then brings them towards purchasing. You know,Â Â  a consulting call with me or purchasing one of myÂ 
courses and that's the conversion. So think aboutÂ Â  how every single piece of content is accomplishingÂ 
one or all of those three, lead generation,Â Â  lead nurture, and lead conversion. I would recommendÂ 
you actually write that down on a sticky note,Â Â  put it beside your computer. So that you keep thatÂ 
in mind and never forget that when you're creatingÂ Â  content. Because we are not here to create contentÂ 
for the sake of content. That's like throwingÂ Â  spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. We'reÂ 
not about that. We are doing this intentionally toÂ Â  grow our businesses, right? After hearingÂ 
that I want to know what you think about that?Â  Have you ever thought about that before? HaveÂ 
you unintentionally been just creating contentÂ Â  for the sake of content or have you been usingÂ 
these three? Let me know in the comments below.Â Â  Having an effective social media marketingÂ 
strategy is so important, why? Because this isn'tÂ Â  a hobby, this is a business. We're not doing thisÂ 
just for fun although, your business should be fun.Â Â  We want to be creating something that is going toÂ 
give us an ROI a return on investment. A return onÂ Â  energy, a turn on the money that we invest, a returnÂ 
on the time that we invest. Ideally, we want toÂ Â  be able to reach more people and you know it'sÂ 
kind of funny when I hear people talk about you know get rich quick schemes. I'm not trying toÂ 
help you get rich slowly either. So when you have aÂ Â  strategy that's going to be the fastest path toÂ 
cash, to growing your business, to reaching moreÂ Â  people, and making the impact that you want toÂ 
make, and social media marketing can be one ofÂ Â  the most effective ways. Because our audiences areÂ 
on social media all the time and if we know howÂ Â  to utilize that to reach them, to give them value,Â 
and then to lead gen, lead nurture, and convert themÂ Â  into a customer. That's how we're going to grow andÂ 
that's how we're also going to be able to make ourÂ Â  impact in the world. By allowing them to grow inÂ 
the ways that our products and services provide.Â Â  So just posting, just creating content, spray andÂ 
pray, putting it out, throwing spaghetti at the wall. That's not a strategy. Again, go back to leadÂ 
generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion,Â Â  that is your strategy. So even if you're brandÂ 
new to business. You might be thinking, ""Well, howÂ Â  do I create a strategy if I've never doneÂ 
this before? I got to test my content."" Absolutely, but you're also going to test your contentÂ 
with intention. As a new business or an existingÂ Â  business these following tips are going to beÂ 
really important for you, to make sure that youÂ Â  have them in place. First of all, is your brandingÂ 
so that people can recognize you. If I were to sayÂ Â  to you right now, just do it. What does that makeÂ 
you think of? Nike, right? If I showed you theseÂ Â  golden arches. What would that make you think of?
McDonald's, right? They have these images or theyÂ Â  have this slogan that is recognizable all over theÂ 
world. Think about how you can create your brandingÂ Â  to be memorable for your audience. Something thatÂ 
they resonate with. Something that they get aÂ Â  feeling about. I mean, I don't know about you butÂ 
I think about Nike, and I think about athleticism,Â Â  I think about excellence, I think about hard workÂ 
and determination, and perseverance. I think aboutÂ Â  McDonald's and I think about happy meals. I lovedÂ 
having meals as a kid. It made me happy. It wasÂ Â  this like fun experience with my brother, my littleÂ 
brother, or my parents, or my friends. You know, theÂ Â  birthday parties and the jungle gyms and stuff.
It's a fun experience for me. What do you wantÂ Â  your business to be about and how can you makeÂ 
sure that everything you put out on social mediaÂ Â  is aligned with that branding? The other piece ofÂ 
creating your branding is going to be the storiesÂ Â  that you tell. So I recommend for every client thatÂ 
I ever work with or for anyone that ever listensÂ Â  to these videos to create a story inventory. WriteÂ 
that down, story inventory. What is your story?Â  You have multiple stories. You have your originÂ 
story of how you came to be who you are today.Â  What was the thing that encouraged youÂ 
to grow or start this business that you have,Â Â  and what are the pivotal moments along the wayÂ 
that taught you lessons or shaped you into whoÂ Â  you are today? I would actually recommend having aÂ 
google doc or a huge notebook where you just brainÂ Â  dump all of your stories. This might be childhoodÂ 
lessons, it might be experiences with your family,Â Â  it might be you discovering your expertise or yourÂ 
skills, or what it was that encouraged you to startÂ Â  this business that you have today, and anytime youÂ 
create a piece of content you can go to your storyÂ Â  inventory and share one of those stories in yourÂ 
content, that people are going to resonate with. The reason why I urge you to tell stories inÂ 
your content is because stories stand the testÂ Â  of time. Stories have been brought through fromÂ 
generation to generation. The things that carryÂ Â  on our culture or generations of wisdom is theÂ 
stories that we tell and that we carry on, and asÂ Â  you tell these stories people resonate with them.
They're captivated, they move in closer,Â Â  they want to hear them. Think about your favoriteÂ 
movies that you love to watch. You're following aÂ Â  storyline. You're connecting with the protagonistÂ 
the main character. You're on the edge of yourÂ Â  seat watching them as they go through their trialsÂ 
and their tribulations and by the end of the movieÂ Â  why do you feel that adrenaline rush or sometimesÂ 
that like serotonin or dopamine hit? That you justÂ Â  love this character that you fall in love withÂ 
over the last like an hour and a half to two hours.Â  Well, it's because you've watched their journeyÂ 
from start to finish. It's that you watch themÂ Â  hit rock bottom. You watch them climb their way upÂ 
and because of that, you cheer louder when they win.Â Â  Whether that means they got the girl or landedÂ 
the dream job or won the race. You got to seeÂ Â  what they went through and you resonate with them.
Whether you've been in the same experience or thatÂ Â  you can relate to something similar that you'veÂ 
experienced. When you can share that through yourÂ Â  content that's going to create this undeniableÂ 
connection with your audience. You know, I see aÂ Â  lot of new businesses focus too much on fun factsÂ 
and tidbits, instead of going deep into the stories.Â Â  When I first started my business I was a socialÂ 
media manager and I was also a full-time dentalÂ Â  hygienist. That was one of my first jobs is,Â 
I was doing social media for the dental officeÂ Â  I worked at and sure I could have made posts aboutÂ 
how many times a day to brush your teeth andÂ Â  and fun facts about cavities and fluorideÂ 
and stuff. But that's not the stuff that makesÂ Â  people stop scrolling. That's not the stuff thatÂ 
captivates them and makes them think about itÂ Â  for for days on end. The stuff that makes them stopÂ 
what they're doing and pay attention is the story. So, I would find stories from the people at ourÂ 
office or I would make up a funny story aboutÂ Â  our office goldfish and that's the thing thatÂ 
gets a reaction. So think about that as you'reÂ Â  creating your content. There's nothing wrong withÂ 
sharing those fun facts and those tidbits. But canÂ Â  you tie it into a story that people will actuallyÂ 
stop the scroll and pay attention to? Now beforeÂ  I tell you about my proven tactics to landing yourÂ 
dream clients through social media. Make sure thatÂ Â  you hit that subscribe button. If you're anÂ 
entrepreneur and you're looking to up-levelÂ Â  and grow and scale your business, make sureÂ 
to subscribe. Because I'm putting out videosÂ Â  like this every week. Okay, how to land your dreamÂ 
clients on social media? I have three tactics I'mÂ Â  going to share with you. The first one is a strongÂ 
call to action at the end of every single video. Remember when I was giving the example about leadÂ 
generation. Maybe I tell this really great storyÂ Â  and I segue it into giving them the answer to thatÂ 
if they click the link below and they get the PDF, or the ebook or they watch the next video
or they sign up for a webinar. Whatever that thingÂ Â  is that next step that I want them to take. ByÂ 
telling them what to do, by inviting them, that isÂ Â  a call to action. That's me saying, ""Here's the nextÂ 
step that you can take to get more value from me.Â Â  Click the link below."" It's a strong call to action.Â 
When I first started creating content on socialÂ Â  media I didn't know what that was. I didn'tÂ 
know that I'm supposed to tell them what toÂ Â  do next. I think I kind of assumed like, ""Well, ifÂ 
they like the video, maybe they'll subscribe orÂ Â  maybe they'll reach out to me, maybe they'll email me."" Â 
You can't assume that because they don't knowÂ Â  that they're supposed to do that or they don'tÂ 
have a reason to. You have to give them a reason to act.Â  So having a strong call to action telling themÂ 
where to go, that's where you also get to activelyÂ Â  pursue that relationship. It's like being on a dateÂ 
with somebody, if you were on a date and you wantedÂ Â  to have that second date. I mean, sure you canÂ 
play hard to get but they might also be thinking,Â Â  ""Did that even go well? Do they like me? ShouldÂ 
this go anywhere?"", and then what if that'sÂ Â  like a misconnection. Instead, just ask for theÂ 
second date, ask them to take action click theÂ Â  link below, join your email list and continueÂ 
that relationship. Speaking of dating, the nextÂ Â  concept that I love to share is know, like, trust.Â 
Your audience to be able to take that actionÂ Â  needs to know you, like you, and trust you, and IÂ 
use this dating analogy to create that image for you.Â Â  That you're not just going right in for theÂ 
proposal. You're nurturing your audience throughÂ Â  this valuable content. So that when you do haveÂ 
that call to action it's a no-brainer. BecauseÂ Â  they know you, they like you, they trust you. if youÂ 
didn't take the effort to date your audience. It would be the equivalent of someone coming up toÂ 
you on the street and being like, ""Hey want to getÂ Â  married?"". You're like, ""I don't know you. You don'tÂ 
know my last name. You haven't taken me to dinner.""Â Â  You gotta get to know your audience and they needÂ 
to get to know you, and that's by creating valuableÂ Â  content. Now, that's not to say that you can't haveÂ 
calls to action your content right from the get-go.Â Â  But that you lead with value before you bringÂ 
them to a call to action, and the way we do thatÂ Â  is through the third tactic that I like to callÂ 
the 80/20 rule. Now this can be 80% and 20% in one piece of content or it can be 80/20 inÂ 
your whole content structure. So an example isÂ Â  you know the post example that I gave you before.
Where I told a story and that's like 80 percent ofÂ Â  the post and 20 percent of the post was the callÂ 
to action. So I led with value, I told them a storyÂ Â  that hopefully tugged at their heartstrings orÂ 
showed them the path and painted that that pictureÂ Â  of what life could be like if they follow thisÂ 
strategy that I'm about to tell them when theyÂ Â  click the link below. So having the 80/20 rule isÂ 
going to be really important for building thatÂ Â  know like trust factor. Dating your audience andÂ 
leading to the call to action in a way that isn'tÂ Â  abrasive like going straight for the proposal.Â 
So remember all in all lead with lead generation, leadÂ Â  nurture, and lead conversion. When you have thatÂ 
in mind with every piece of content you createÂ Â  that's what's going to boost brand loyalty andÂ 
sales. If you want to learn more about creatingÂ Â  content that converts into cash flow and builds aÂ 
raving audience for you. I have a training on justÂ Â  the thing. If you click the link below you can getÂ 
free access to my next training, I'll see you there."
ozMCb0wOnMU,"5 Steps to Building a Personal Brand You Feel Good About | The Way We Work, a TED series",Unknown,322799,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ozMCb0wOnMU/hq720.jpg,2023-04-05 00:00:00,374,TED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozMCb0wOnMU,"Whether you realize it or not,
you have a personal brand. If I looked you up on Google and didn't find anything about you
on the first page of results, that's your personal brand. If I found an out-of-date LinkedIn profile or a bunch of random social media posts, that, too, is your personal brand. [The Way We Work] People tend to think
about a personal brand as bragging, self-promotion and all about yourself. But it's actually something
much more important. It's your reputation. In other words,
itâ€™s how people perceive you -- your friends, colleagues
or the general public -- and it's what people think about you
when they hear your name as well as what people say about you
when you're not in the room. In our connected world, every single one of us
has a personal brand, whether we like it or not. This is because whenever we engage
with people both in person and online -- thatâ€™s every interaction or everything
we post, upload or comment on -- we're creating a reputational
narrative about ourselves. Your reputation is already out there. The question is: Do you want to be the one
whoâ€™s driving and shaping this story? Or do you want chance
or algorithms to be doing it for you? I think most people would agree
that they want to take control. And what this means is we need to make
some very intentional decisions so our brand stays in our hands. Let me walk you through five key steps
to building a strong personal brand in a way that feels good. First, you need to figure out
what your goal is. Let's start by answering
a foundational question: What do you want your personal brand
to help you accomplish? Are you looking to change jobs
or transition into a new industry, and you need your brand
to reflect a new skill set? Maybe you're looking to get a promotion
at your current organization and you need everyone to know
all the amazing things that you've accomplished in your career. Or maybe you're launching a new business and you want to build your brand around the products or services
that you're offering. Whatever your goal is,
write it down and make it specific so that you're working
towards a clear outcome. Next, you'll want to get clear
on what you want to be known for. In other words, how do you want people
to describe you as a professional? Start by answering the question,
""So what do you do?"" And I'm not just talking
about your job title. Are you a teacher who focuses
on social and emotional learning? Or maybe you're a project manager who is reliable and always gets
things done on time. Or maybe you're an artist who makes beautiful ceramic pots
from natural materials. What you want to do
is dig deeper into the what, how and why behind your work so you can make it concrete
and easy to remember. Just make sure to lead with something
that doesn't cause confusion. For example, I once coached someone
who called herself a ""death midwife,"" which no one understood. But when she started introducing herself
as a grief counselor who works with families
during a time of loss, all of a sudden everyone got it. If you're stumped, think
about how you can stand out from the crowd in your industry. What are the things that make you unique? Are there specific talents and expertise
that you've acquired in your career? What do you know more about
than most people? Sit down and make a list and you might start to surprise yourself
about all the things you know. Now let's think about the audience you want to share
your personal brand with. The reality is, your personal
brand is not about you. It's about the people you want
to educate with the skills, knowledge and value you can provide. Who you decide to focus on
should be based on two things: the goal of your personal brand and the people who can best benefit
from your unique talents and skills. So spend some time thinking
about these two questions: Who can most gain
from what you have to share, and how exactly can you see
yourself helping them? Here's where it all starts
to come together. Let's pull all your answers
into a single mission statement that describes who you are, what you do, who you do it for and the transformation
you can create in people's lives. Let's take the example of the teacher. â€œMy name is Alma,
and Iâ€™m a third-grade teacher who specializes in social
and emotional learning. I work with students
to teach them the skills for fostering empathy and compassion so they can thrive and contribute
to a more caring world."" Let's take the project manager. â€œMy name is Jennifer, and I'm a project manager
for a sustainable fashion company. I work with teams
across different departments to plan, organize and direct
innovative marketing campaigns that engage customers
while also increasing brand loyalty."" Mission statements
are going to look wildly different depending on who you are in your career. But whatever your mission statement is, write it down and put it
somewhere prominent. You can use it to make decisions
about how you speak about yourself when you first meet someone, to the communities
you want to share it with. Let's start building
your personal brand online. There are two key personal branding assets
you should think about developing: a personal website and social media. What's so important
about a personal website is that it allows you to take full control
over your online reputation. It offers the most flexibility in sharing
your brand and value to others in a much deeper way
than a resume or a LinkedIn profile. People want to work with others
they like, know and trust, and your personal website
provides you an opportunity to share more about your
personality through photos as well as more about your
career and life story. This, in turn will differentiate you
from others in your industry. Social media is also a great way
to share your personal brand with the audience
you're looking to connect with. However, I suggest trying
not to be on every platform. Pick one that aligns with your goals as well as where your audience
spends most of its time. If you're an artist or a creative,
Instagram is a great fit. If you work in a more
corporate environment, LinkedIn is the place you want to be. When posting, focus
on being helpful to others. Share interesting articles
relevant to your industry, post ideas or opinions
that can benefit colleagues, and like or comment on posts
shared by the people you follow. The key is to always engage in a way that both reinforces your personal brand
while also bringing value to others. Look, I know this may all sound
a bit intimidating, but try to think of this branding process
as an opportunity for personal growth. It's your chance to dig deeper
into who you truly are and who you want to become. This, in turn, will provide you
the clarity you need on how you can make
your greatest impact in the world."

Network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-eIWetPKjM,you have to understand that no matter what it looks like in this very moment for your business whether you are in the negative in your bank account right now whether you are investing every single thing that you got into reinvestment back to stock up more inventory or to do more marketing or to run more social media Facebook ads or whatever it is that no matter how dark it might seem in this moment that if you believe it so Will other people I believe that I'm in a room with a whole bunch of multi-millionaires that are going to change the world but it doesn't mean anything for me to believe that now you have to hey what's good hey I want to just drop in before we get started with this video this is going to be Jalil with north 13 Jalil has produced content with eyl and really wanted to bring them inside of our community so the video that you're about to watch is actually us inside of our Inner Circle experience we do one of these events every quarter without Inner Circle members and inside of this event we also like to bring our resources like to bring our partners and like to bring other high-level entrepreneurs so what you're about to see is very very high level very top secret we don't bring people that's not inside of our community into our Inner Circle experience but you know what we're going to do that right here because this video was so good once again let's go tune in to Jalil uh today I'm even coming to learn from you uh with the amount of information that you got just with content and working with you know all these large companies and businesses that you've been able to see and you know just get a whole different feel that we normally don't get to see on when creating content and working with these type of companies so that's what we came here for today just to talk about a chop up so well first before you even go I just want to give a huge shout out to the founders of world and vision I've been following the journey it's so crazy I was literally watching you guys um back when I was sleeping in my parents crib you know what I'm saying watching you guys Vision looking on YouTube seeing the journey watching different uh podcast episodes just all of it you know so to be able to sit here and then see I'm humbled um I don't know what you're talking about learning for me I'm hoping I could say something that uh that inspires some people to to take some action and do some things but I just want to make sure that you guys get the flowers that you deserve because you built an amazing platform it's truly impacting the culture and I appreciate the kind is that you guys have shown and the dedication and passion I'm here to continue to serve whatever way I can to help the audience all right man cool hey I got a few questions I had to write these things down because you would content guys so how to make sure it's kind of work all right so my first question is how should creators approach creating and distributing content on multiple platforms so how many of you guys have ever heard the principal story of the the tale of two rabbits anybody ever heard that story before about show hands nobody Okay cool so it's a it's a proverb an old proverb that talks about the principle of he who chases two rabbits catches neither I'm not stuck I'm just gonna let that Sizzle in your mind for a second so I'm a Storyteller so I like to tell stories so just indulge me for a second imagine you're running around you have this vision of being able to feed these two rabbits and you want to be able to make sure that they're taken care of because we're not going to kill the rabbits right we're gonna feed the rabbits on this one right and you want to feed the rabbits and you're going around you're going around then they're just all over the place so first you see this one you're like okay I'm going to lock in on Bucky if you want to call the first one Bucky and we're going to call the other one Bluey is that cool all right Bucky and Bluey so I'm chasing Bucky I'm trying to find Bucky and then but then then blue okay wait no I gotta get blue and then I'm trying to go get Bucky and I'm trying to get and now you continue to keep going after it and now what do you have at the end of the day none of them so if you continue to chase two rabbits or you chase different multiple verticals of whether it be content or even some of you guys businesses how many of you guys know that you might be guilty of being the the dunk man on the street that got the trench coat where you just pull open you got the you got the Rolex and then you got the champagne bottle and then you got a rose and they how many of y'all are guilty that just oh nobody's going to make okay it's cool just keep looking forward thank you for being honest my sister I appreciate that I appreciate that right we got to be honest so in those times and in those moments where you feel confused about how do I go about my content you have to remember that principle of he who chases two rabbits catches neither we used to hear yo you got to be on Facebook and you got to be on Instagram you got to be on YouTube and you got to be on YouTube shorts and you got to be on Instagram stories and then you got to be on all of these different platforms but what we found now in today's era is that you want to really start concentrating all your energy on mastering a specific platform now the reason why you want to think about it that way is because social media is no longer social media the way that we understand it social media is bona fide dignified straight up TV right here right now so Instagram is serving as Turner Broadcast Network Twitter is serving as CBS Tick Tock is serving as uh VH1 right whatever these different platforms that you grew up watching consuming these are networks so you want to think about your space on these networks as channels does that make sense and once you decide to go all in on one platform especially in today's world and we're going to talk about why and how you should pick these different platforms as you guys are trying to scale your content but you want to really be intentional and thoughtful about how you go about placing yourself in each of these verticals because a lot of people are making the mistake of being so spread thin and guess what many of us I don't know about you but when I started building this company in my parents basement with no money with no college education I was a year behind all of my friends and all four years of high school added 2.86 GPA no one talked to me about business funding nobody talked to me about scaling a business or I didn't even know any entrepreneurs who had made successful amounts of of income and live the life that I wanted to live you know throughout my upbringing I never saw that I had to go out and see and seek it and find it so even having these platforms that world of vision has created for you is so powerful because now the information is being brought to you instead of you even having to go search for it so in those moments nobody taught me these things so I had to go out and I had to kind of like figure it out does that make sense so we have to always remember is that as we're going to grow these verticals and as we're going about these things we have to be intentional about focusing our Direction because like I was talking about before with no funding and no education you don't have 35 50 000 to be able to go pay a media team to be all right we're focused on Twitter okay we're focused on Tick Tock okay we're focused on Instagram so everybody can stop beating themselves up because they can't compete with Alex from Ozzy and Layla hermosi and all the people that you see that you look up to are Gary vaynerchuk all these people that you look up to because you don't have that kind of a budget so what do you do when you're looking to scale your brand looking to scale your business but you don't have that kind of a budget you go all in with Sweat Equity does that make sense so you go all in on Sweat Equity find a platform that's going to be the best platform for you so can I break down a little bit about what the pla how we how we get into platforms are y'all are y'all awake there we go I don't know about you I'm here to give free information because of how these gentlemen have served me and I want to make sure I serve you the same way so like we getting to it we get into it all right all right and let's grow right I'm here to make sure I want when you're done when you go home I want every single one of you to look at your whether it's your partner whether it's your spouse whether it's your kids whether it's your cousins your nieces your nephews your daughter your son I want you to look at them in the eye with confidence because you decided to come with an investment of time and energy and you now have a plan where there is no vision people perish so you have to have a very clear and decisive plan for where it is that you're going in your life and there's nothing like when you have a vision world and vision there's nothing like when you have a vision and you can then also back it with confidence because you have a plan does that make sense so when we look at what these verticals are these different things let's talk about something like YouTube YouTube is the mecca write that down if you're taking notes YouTube is the mecca when it comes down to being able to build authentic very deep rooted community that is the place let's think about it very practical because I'm I'm not gonna lie I don't I'm not the sharpest tool in the shade I'm not the brightest bubble in the ceiling so I need things dumbed down for me anybody else like me by showing hands please right I need it all the way broken down right so here's how you want to think about content on a YouTube perspective think about the fact that someone is deciding as a subscriber right to subscribe to your life to subscribe to your content and spend 10 20 or 30 minutes because it's a more long form based platform on your specific thing that you're deciding to educate them on I'm saying yes or yes so we wanted if you're willing to give me 10 minutes of your time then now I have to make it meaningful and impactful so now I know that there's more intention and investment be it time energy and money resources to get people to engage with that because I've got a whole majority of attention for 10 minutes so that's going to be a little bit more of a time a little bit more effort and a little excuse me a little bit more money that you have to invest in that platform so that may not be immediate gratification hear what I'm saying to you that might not be immediate gratification you might have to go on the YouTube Journey for a good three or five years before you might even see something stick but if you commit to that and you're going to spend that time understanding you're building a media platform does that make sense so people who are watching that for long periods of time over and over again what's going to end up happening is that you're going to see a loyal audience who's watched you grow how many of you guys are here because you watch world and vision growing YouTube I show a hands please and now look at where you are this is the byproduct so we got to understand if we want to invest in YouTube we got to be willing to go the distance with that okay everybody say go to distance all right now let's talk about something like tick tock instant gratification instant gratification now you want to know what Tick Tock is like eating candy when you eat candy you get a nice sugar high and it feels good but then next thing you know you crash right what you have to understand about Tick Tock is that you might put out a piece of content tomorrow that hits for a million views two million views three million views and overnight you got 25 50 35 whatever it is thousand followers that come but don't think that that means that you ate wholesome food and that that's going to stick that was candy why because those people consumed 10 000 pieces of content over the course of the last two hours and you just so happen to be one thing and they were like oh that's dope follow boom next person that's not necessarily the place where you're building long-standing Community now does it mean that you can't be like a Keith Lee and build a very strong solid foundation of a community no it doesn't mean that but what did he focus on one platform he went all in on what tick tock so as he continued to build the Rapport and show up and show up and show and feed it now he was able to see something be able to grow does that make sense so you want to look at that the same exact way now can you get viewership can you get sales can you get instant gratification absolutely am I telling you not to do Tick Tock no I'm just trying to give you an educated like uh assessment of how you're going to spend your investment of time into the platform as you're looking to scale these verticals and then if you're asking me Instagram is another place that almost operates like Tick Tock because the most case use that you're going to get as far as reach viewership and and gain uh audience and traction is Thrills which also works and adjacently to to tick tock does that make sense and then also it's a place to look cool right there's a different type of a platform where it's more you know uh how you look the aesthetic of how you look all these different things right so you have to find the platform that makes the most sense for you and for your business specifically but understand the game plan to how you're going into it now let's talk about the other question that he asked me which was how do you create on on behalf of these different platforms everybody I want you to understand something if you decide to go to China tomorrow and you decide to speak English all of those people that are looking at you guess what they're going to look at you like real confused because they don't speak English or maybe they don't speak English as fluently as we do here in America what do they speak many of them Mandarin you have to give each geographical territory what it needs to be able to survive and excuse me not just survive thrive so Tick Tock is a geographical territory Instagram is a geographical territory YouTube is a geographical territory so each of those have different feelings and feelings of content and culture and dynamics of how people interact with the platform and you have to give the platform what it needs and what it wants so you need to look at some of the creators who are within your Niche find those different people and here's one of the key things that you can do adjust your algorithm to be the consumer that you want to be able to have as your uh key targeted Avatar does that make sense so here's what you want to think about who are the Target demographic that you're going after in your business think about what they look like what they talk like what they consume where they shop who they're associated with the types of content that they're consuming and adjust your algorithm as a consumer not to be the person fellas of girls shaking their behinds all day when you're on your explore page because your explore page is a representation of your mind and where your mind's at and on your for you page no here's what you want to do what you want want to do is make your algorithm look like the consumer that you're trying to Target so that that way now every single day as you're consuming content and media you're now thinking like who your customer you're seeing what they like you're seeing what they want to identify with and now you're able to understand exactly what their lifestyle is because you're consuming that the last thing I want to say on this question I want everybody here who has ever struggled with insecurity being able to not feel comfortable with themselves looking at themselves on camera your parents didn't affirm you your brother didn't affirm you your your last recent relationship your ex didn't affirm you and now you have low self-esteem issues and different things that are going on and you're not able to to feel good about what it means for you to create content I want every single one of you guys to please be a business owner and not be a personally uh personally attached to the content that you're creating because once you remove the emotion from content creation and for what content performance looks like you will start to see the shift in your business and you will start to see the shift in your content because you will start to understand this is not a bad performing video because my self-worth is is something wrong with me people don't like me people don't like how I look oh I'm unattractive oh people don't like my brand oh my logo sucks oh my logo is not as good as world and vision oh my Graphics aren't as good as world and vision oh my Graphics aren't as good as all these other brands are no people aren't attacking you they want to be able to consume the business so many of us what ends up happening is that we allow our self-esteem to be the reason why we don't create content and now our businesses never grow because we are so emotionally attached to the outcome of what's taking place instead of removing our emotion and being a business owner and being a provider and somebody that's going to go home from this event look at your people in the eye and say I got a plan it's okay we good you're doing this for your family you're doing this for your loved ones you're doing for people that that you care about the most you need to make sure that you remove the emotion so that you and your family can eat and you can leave a generational Legacy for whatever brand that you are building and whatever God's called you to do make sense all gas no brakes getting ready I'm gonna get into my next question uh because honestly we learning more about AI we call chat our best friend right now so you know with AI being on the front for it have you implemented AI into your processes in Korean content if so can you explain that and if not why 100 so we've definitely incorporate Incorporated parts of AI I do want to make sure that I make this disclaimer to everybody okay AI has been around for years right like this is not some new form of like oh now because Chad gbt went crazy overnight now we got Ai No Chad gbt was just an extension of what it is that we've already been dealing with right so don't be afraid and alarm because everybody kind of feels like oh my God ai ai what's going to happen you want to understand that AI actually is going to help to further intensify your creative capability I'm not stuck I'm letting that marinate am on for a second if you will allow yourself to start focusing on the right way and the right perspective of AI you will be able to make sure that you keep up with the forward progression of where the world is moving so instead of judging it and being afraid of it and be like Oh Lord the robot's gonna come kill us all of that right you want to start focusing your intention on okay how can I work with this because I believe and I'm a Believer so I don't hold that back I believe that God created every single one of us with dominion and with authority which means that you are supposed to subdue the Earth so you're not going to let no machine do outdo me no God made me and His Image and his likeness so I'm going to tell the machine what to do does that make sense you have rulership so understanding that about yourself now is going to set you up for a lot of success because now what you want to focus on is how do you prompt how can you create proper prompting for the AI tools and using chat gbt to do things like like we do content creation for caption writing copywriting email email writing right we're using it for uh for social media posts as far as what kind of posts should we use for this particular demographic the whole idea behind things like Chad gbt is the more specific that you can get is the more better the outcome that you're going to receive so what you have to look at and what you have to think about when it comes to your specific business is how can I get more specific one of the reasons why people don't succeed when it comes to business especially with their marketing is because they're not being specific enough you say that you want to win in business but you don't have a Clint a very concrete and clear identity of or identification of what that actually looks like so I want to win I'm ready to grind okay great I love that for you we going through that but what does success look like can you tell me can you describe it I want everybody to close their eyes really quickly indulge me for a second those who are winners are going to do this those who are not are not the winners in the room are going to close their eyes and I want you to Envision what your dream lifestyle looks like all right Envision what your dream lifestyle looks like do you have the picture of the house that you that you are ultimately looking for in your head right now yes or yes can you see it do you do you know whether it's a modern home or a traditional home do you know if it's brick front or is it is it another type of stone wall is it gray is acting you don't have to you don't have to respond it out loud but just think about it in your head right what kind of car is in the driveway what year is the car what make is the car what does the car smell like when you get inside of it what color is it how fast is the dashboard when you get out and you walk in what's the first smell that you smell as soon as you walk inside of the house what furniture do you have what paint is the ceiling is it high ceilings or is it low ceilings is it led white light or a cool light or is it warm lighting is there a pool in the background is there a large Windows floor to ceiling everybody open your eyes real quick what did we just do it we did a chat gbt prompt you thought you were envisioning your dream lifestyle no we did a Chad gbt prompt the more specific that you can be is the better that the outcome of what the AI is going to give you so when you want to start thinking and not just chat beat Chad gbt because this is not just the AI conversation the most masterful people who are going to be able to use that AI platform and tell it what to do are going to be the people who know how to be the most specific so start thinking about how to tell the AI what to do there's many different other verticals but to be very transparent with you in our business that's the main one that we're using and I'm not gatekeeping I promise you this I literally talked about this with my brother Justin on the way here I was like yo what do I tell them because I'm really only using chat gbt right now and he's like just tell them that's what you're using so I said okay cool and that's what I did it's perfect I appreciate that man hey my next question what type of content should creators focus on creating what tips would you give them and how can they push their content to go out 100 so I want everybody to understand when you're creating you want to tap into that childlike wonder my favorite book it says except that you be like a little kid that's when you're going to experience what heaven feels like on Earth so you want to approach every single day with the opportunity to create I would be very very honest with y'all if you really really want to see what it's like to live in childlike Wonder read this book it's going to be you're going to be like wait what Jalil it's a children's book but it's one of the best books I've ever read in my life and it's called Raj and the best day ever Raj and the best day ever the book talks about a young tiger like figure right and his dad and his dad is going to do what we usually do as adults where he's just going to to go be an adult for the day so he's waking up and the first thing he's doing to do is that he's got to go to the cleaners because he's got to take his take you know take the take the clothes of the cleaners whatever then after he leaves there he goes and he's gotta uh go get some mail from the post office then when he leaves there he's got to go and he's taking the bus to and from all these different places right he's going to you know get the mail then he's going to get something to eat then he's going home then he's got to go pick up the laundry again and he's just doing all these got to go to the car like you know just different different places right that he's that he's going to right throughout the day now we see it as he's just being an adult he's he's adulting right but that's not how Raj saw it Raj saw it as oh my gosh we're getting ready to go to the cleaners that's my favorite place because I get a chance to see the different colors of the yellow shirts and the red shirts and this going up and down the line and then we're going to go on the Big Red Bus and The Big Red Bus is going to take us to the to the uh to the mail office where uh now we get a chance to see all of my favorite posts uh post you know what a male people call mailmen and male woman Etc right he's given all these details here's the perspective of why that book is so valuable it's perspective it's the way that you see the world one person sees a piece of content as oh man I gotta make content today I hate making content another person looks at it like yo I get an opportunity to be able to convince some people about what my brand is and tell the story of what I get a chance to do I want to tell what that story is and I want you to get very very clear some of you guys I hear is very strong for those who are listening to me on the internet and everybody who's in this room there's so many of you guys who you're starting to give up on the vision of why you started you're starting to lose track because you're so caught up in the numbers and you're so caught up in the performance of the engagement that you're forgetting why you started your business the story of why you started this business is so important and you have to tell that to the world that's why I wear this on my chest every single day because this is everything to me nor 13th the name of my company nor 13th the way that this business started was in my Grandmom's house and her basement where me and my cousins would come up with plays shows movies and we would make the adults come after Grandma had family dinner on Sundays pay us to watch our shows and then go back out there and do whatever they was going to do watch the game or whatever they did and I wanted to take that childlike wonder and that childlike imagination and say yo what if I could create something when I get older that will always keep this Spirit of what Innovation and childlike creativity feels like and so what you want to start to understand as you're building your brand everybody say the name of your brand out loud that's how you talk about your brand what's the name of your brand you want the story of that brand to be what you translate as far as how you go about creating content so if that looks like you being a personal brand Creator and you're literally sharing the story of why you got started and how you guys started and going back to your basements or your garages or your parents cribs or wherever it's at that you went to and you want to start showing people what that looks like guess what guess what's going to end up happening you're going to get people who hear that story and be like yo bro that's dope I actually experienced something like that to myself yo I want to support you because I want everybody to write this down facts tell stories sell [Music] facts tell stories sell guess what I don't care about the fact that the shirt that you're producing or the hoodie that you're producing is a hundred percent or excuse me 75 cotton and then the other is polyester guess what I don't care about that is sweat resistant guess what else I don't care about that it was made in Pakistan or was made in an Instanbul or was made in China what I care about is the story that you tell me about what that shirt says the story about what that hoodie says and once you understand that principle that's when you start making the big bucks man hey I got I got one more question for you you dropping you know so many gems right now and like I said I want to say I appreciate you but before we get out of here my last question is you know over the time of working with different people you have seen you know beginner creators to working with people and content creators like eyl McDonald Chevrolet I want to say McDonald's McDonald's and Chevrolet I appreciate you speaking into existence we haven't done McDonald's yet okay but but I just want to make sure that's clear because I want cap I'm not I'm not a cat person you know what I'm saying but McDonald's you know I'm loving it too so what we want to do right hey McDonald's Reach Out reach out but you understand what I mean large companies large influencers what has been the difference between working with people that's just coming up and working with larger companies like that so one of the things that I want everybody to understand is I want everybody say the word excellence Excellence has to be the standard that you live by and when Excellence is your standard and when you live your life by an expectation of Excellence that's what separation from the good and the average and then the less than average there is a realm of excellent dwellers and they usually call that word greatness to be around people and work and partner with people like eyl and all of the amazing brands that you know that we've been able to partner with it is a standard of Excellence where we have now made Excellence Norm by God's grace I can stand before you and share with you guys that North 13th has documented not just black history but global history last week or the week before we were a part of the third and Best Fest we've been we produced all of the invest fests since they started since it was a concept in Rashad's mind right and um last year it goes down on hit in history as the largest global business event that has ever taken place that's world history when we all die there's going to be photographs that are our images that my my team has captured by God's grace that will live beyond all of us it will it will be eternalized every single day that we interact with these different brands we don't get a chance to slip off because guess what as much as Rashad and I may chop it up and Troy and all of the all of the people who are part of eyo in a franchise the moment that we don't produce at the high standard of Excellence guess what appreciate y'all this was great we had a great run but guess what be out Excellence is not something that you do once hear me very well everybody please listen to me Excellence is not something that you do one time Excellence is something that you do every single day of your life and you make a commitment that this is now the standard in which how you live your life every single day why because let's go back to what we said at the beginning of this there's someone that you're going to look in the eyes when you leave this event and you're going to say I have a plan we are good and you're going to feel confident because of the plan that you have Excellence has to be your standard and the difference between working with the brands like the brands that I work with and others is that other people they do not hold themselves to a high standard of Excellence how you do anything is how you do everything in life y'all so if you don't take care of yourself and you don't look presentable for yourself and you don't approach every single day with this enthusiasm and this excitement and this expectation that things are going to go my way that my brand is going to take off that there's going to be opportunity for me that I'm going to give my all to this but whatever it is that you need to tell yourself whatever you are believing for in your own personal Journey as you go throughout your life you have to have that expectation daily so that now greatness becomes your Norm and then greatness becomes your standard I sit here today with promises that I've made to both my mom my dad and my grandma which is the most important promises that I have because I don't have any kids and I don't have a wife yet or a girlfriend right the internet is watching right and and I say all of that to say that these promises mean everything my grandmom is 96 years old and I don't know how much longer she might have left she's cool right now but she could be going tomorrow I looked her in her eyes and I said Grandma I'm going to make sure that the world knows our name and all those sacrifices and those prayers that you pray in the middle of the night where you didn't know how you was going to feed seven kids those prayers were answered by God and I'm going to live those prayers out that crap makes me emotional bro so I realized that now I have to uphold a standard of Excellence your brand must be a standard of Excellence when they think of your brand when they see your logo it should be synonymously tied to Greatness and Excellence that's why when you see Nike you think just do it when you see Nike you think of Excellence you want to make sure that your brand is synonymously tied with whatever that greatness standard looks like for you the main thing that I want to leave every single one of you guys with is this if you take it seriously so so will other people if you build it they will come you have to understand that no matter what it looks like in this very moment for your business whether you are in the negative in your bank account right now whether you are investing every single thing that you got into reinvestment back to stock up more inventory or to do more marketing or to run more social media Facebook ads or whatever it is then no matter how dark it might seem in this moment that if you believe it so other people there will never be an investment that you make that the Universe does not see hard work does not go unnoticed so continue to keep committing continue to keep going continue to keep fighting for it continue to keep thriving for it continue to keep striving for it continue to keep working at it continue to keep waking up every single day with the same level of enthusiasm and the same level of passion and the same level of energy that you need to give until you see the Breakthrough that you're looking for I believe that I'm in a room with a whole bunch of multi-millionaires that are going to change the world let's go [Applause] but it doesn't mean anything for me to believe that now you have to say so that's what you know that's what I'll leave you guys that's big man and we talk about you know believing in yourself because that's all this was this was us believing in ourselves my dad's standing back down the back and like we was battling he was like man you better go to the league you invest that money I'm like nah we doing this brand but that right there and him standing back there and seeing us today he see the belief that we had and what is have become so you guys got to believe even if your parents don't see even if you your friend don't see even if your girlfriend your wife don't see you gotta believe in that and you got to go for it and you gotta make it happen all right because you never know what's gonna be on that other side all right man we appreciate you delivering hey man everybody [Music] thank you [Music]
UpdUHFkh22o,Build a POWERFUL Personal Brand on Social Media in 5 Steps | Branding shoot BTS  ðŸ“¸,Unknown,93297,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UpdUHFkh22o/hq720.jpg,2023-08-30 00:00:00,1117,Modern Millie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpdUHFkh22o,[Music] how can you truly create a powerful personal brand that stands out against the millions of other people online I've worked with three different branding experts over the past few years so in this video I wanted to teach you a DIY way that you can develop your own personal brand in case you don't have the budget to hire someone else to help you so to teach this I'm going to walk you through the exact process that my team and I did this past year to develop our updated branding for my new course bundle the bsp model as always time stamps are in the description below because I value your time and you already know why you're here so let's just get into it to create a strong and powerful personal brand it's probably going to be helpful to know what a personal brand is so there are a few definitions online out there like the process of defining and promoting what you stand for as an individual or the process of creating an identity for yourself as an individual but the definition that we're going to dive into because I think it explains it the best is the one from Wikipedia so Wikipedia says scooting over personal branding is the conscious and intentional effort to create and influence public perception of an individual by positioning them as an authority in their industry elevating their credibility and differentiating themselves from the competition to ultimately Advance their career widen their circle of influence and have a larger impact so good so let's break it down a little bit because that was a mouthful to be honest personal branding this is the conscious and intentional effort to create and influence public perception of an individual let's just talk about that part branding is more than just like pretty colors and what you want to be known for those are a part of it what it comes down to is your intention of what you want to be known for being in alignment with the public perception of you and your brand so if you could get your personal branding to communicate exactly what you want to be perceived as then we can continue the definition you position yourself as an authority in your industry elevating your credibility and differentiating yourself from the competition obviously there's multiple ways and reasons we want to establish our personal brand but ultimately this can advance your career widen your circle of influence and have a larger impact all right so how do you actually do this I created the five-step DIY method to help you develop your personal brand in one day so the five steps that we're going to go over in this video are values Vibes visuals voice and content tried to come up with another V but I couldn't I wanted to call it like the five V's so values Vibes and visuals this is going to be part of your creation process in developing your branding and then your voice and content is part of the implementation and the stuff that you put out to the world jumping straight into your brand values brand values are the key values that guide how you operate and make decisions as an individual or within your business while this could be a whole video itself diving into this topic basically what you're going to do is pick the three to five words that are the most important to you how do you want to run your business what do you want your brand to communicate this was the first thing I did when figuring out how I wanted to position the bsp model I set values for it the four values that I chose were professional generous simple and transparent I felt like those were the most important things for me to communicate with this new course bundle so basically the bsp model bsp standing for build scale profit it's a course bundle for Content creators that teaches them from A to Z how to grow a business as a content creator right email list branding in Instagram YouTube Tik Tok making money all the things that's what the course bundle teaches I wanted this course bundle to come across as professional as possible while being generous and giving away as much knowledge as I can for the lowest cost possible while having it be a simple clear path for Content creators to follow and of course being transparent you all know how important transparency is for me authenticity all those things so that is really what I wanted this course bundle and Community to communicate to Future students to help you narrow down your brand values I'm going to pop up here on the screen two 100 value examples so you can pause this video right now pick a handful that stick out to you and then move on if after this video you're like Millie I need more branding info how can I take what you're teaching even further or maybe you want to dive into making logos picking your fonts anything that I didn't cover today I do have a free link below how to create a brand style guide which was created by HubSpot who's also the sponsor of this video yes this is free and it's 40 pages a 40 page brand style guide that will teach you everything that you need to know so inside of this guide there's tips for logo Styles fonts and colors for your brand you'll see examples of brand style guides from recognizable companies across the globe like Netflix and of course templates to help you get started documenting your own style guide I love partnering with HubSpot because they're always creating free read resources like this for creators entrepreneurs and small businesses so download the guide below after this video for more branding tips step two let's set the Vibes for your brand this is my favorite part not going to lie this is one of my favorite things that I did when I was creating my branding for its Modern Millie and then I carried the same concept for my branding for the bsp model so basically you just want to ask yourself how do you want your brand to feel to other people do you want it to feel exciting and fun or warm and inviting ask yourself if my business or my personal brand was a location what would it look like is it a coffee shop is it a beach hut in Hawaii what does that location look like is it like a modern mansion home visualize it try to get the feels and then create a Pinterest board with these Vibes with its Modern Millie I always knew I wanted it to be fun and warm and very much me I gravitated towards teals and oranges and even in my Pinterest board Not only was I saving photos and pictures of visuals and locations that I liked but I also saved different textures that I liked different color combos different fonts different logos of other brands that inspired me and made me go yeah that's that's Modern Millie this is the same thing I did for the bsp model what did I want the vibe of that course bundle to be next we have visuals after you've created your Pinterest board we're going to narrow down even further and these visuals are elements like your color palette fonts logos and even your brand photos that you use across your branding your website Instagram carousels so the first step narrowing down your color palette I know I say this is my favorite part but again this is another one of my favorite parts when it comes to branding so you're going to take your Pinterest board and you're going to turn that into a color palette there are two ways to do this first you can take a screenshot of your Pinterest board a section of your board that just screams your name and you're going to upload that to HTML Color Picker from here you can select specific colors of that screenshot and those will then become your color palette or you can pull up your pinest board on one side of your computer screen and then on the other side of your computer screen go to c.co to really get specific with the colors that you want this is exactly again what I did for build scale profit so with build scale profit I knew okay profit money green I want a good green for my color palette for build I felt like build was setting a foundation the foundation made me think of like earthy dirt you know so I was like okay let's go with like a gold a brownish and and scale I just wanted like a dominant professional color that was a potentially common color in social media so like Facebook and Linkedin are very professional those are Blues so I knew those were kind of the colors that I wanted to play around with and even the Pinterest board had those similar Vibes so I used c.co to get really specific and pick the colors that I ended up loving and choosing for the bsp model now for more info on fonts logos again again you could download the brand guide below because we focused on colors I want to talk a little bit about photos because your photos and colors they're going to be used everywhere like sales Pages emails logos the slideshows for my courses are even very specific with brand colors and even I take it further I take it further with the content I create my YouTube videos I usually only wear my brand colors in my YouTube videos You'll see warm oranges Reds yellows neutrals white tan black and even some blues so a light blue dark Blues th those are the main colors that I wear in my videos we took it a step further with the bsp model so after we chose the brand colors we knew that we wanted the sales page to be as consistent as possible with those colors so I booked an Airbnb surprisingly it was one just one city away from me it wasn't that expensive my husband and I went to the Airbnb and took photos which looked a little bit like this on our way to do the brand shoot we're so [Music] excited lower [Music] back now we're excited now we're ready now we're ready let's do it all right we've made it to the Airbnb I want to show you the outfits that I brought how I have everything set up the shot list mood board the colors and the direction that we're going for for this shoot so as you can tell here's the first outfit I'm going to flip my mic around and show you the rest okay outfit number one green I know Green's not usually my brand color but we'll talk about that in a second for outfit number two we have just classic white turtleneck with some jeans going to do like a high bun for that outfit three we have a more corpor look we have these beige pants white crop that won't be inside out and this nice jacket that I got from Zara everybody and then final outfit will be just a cozy sweatsuit so here's the sweats we're going to do bun this is like oh I'm just your everyday content creator type of a look let's go over here oh let's shall we do a tour of the place this is the master bedroom hi hello how are you master bedroom we have the nice bathroom in here which will not be shooting in another bedroom over here potential for shooting I like this little corner it's kind of dark o um uh this is the front door obviously all of our gear is here so it's a little bit of mess but we'll probably shoot here and the kitchen I definitely have a vision for this setup right here another bathroom I love the kitchen but I'm not going to be shooting in the kitchen um and then coming here we're setting up the first shot or John setting up the first shot we're going to shoot on the couch for this outfit so this is the couch and of course we have the nice fireplace outside thinking doing there's a hammock over there I don't know if you could see it thinking of shooting there so I have a new course that I launched and it's called build scale profit model these are the brand colors for the course I wanted it to be like completely different from its Modern Millie and feel a lot more professional so we have like a deep green like this forest green I absolutely love which is weird cuz I usually don't like greens for my brand but I just love that look we have these Navy blues and then kind of gold so those are the brand colors I have this little mood board going on Pinterest of some shots that I really really liked and today we're going to not only take photos we're going to do video as well and then my content creator manager she created a shot list for me so these are extra shots that she would want for using in reals or Tik toks or b-roll other things like that so we have a full day ahead I just finished doing my nails ignore the Apple watch tan line and let's get to shooting [Music] now of course the setup doesn't have to be fancy I've done a branding photo shoot with my sister we simply used our phones she had different outfits picked for her brand colors we walked around my house did different setups and that was our branding shoe before jumping into steps four and five I do want to say if you've learned something new today give this video a thumbs up so that you can help it reach other content creators like yourself who are looking for a little bit more guidance when it comes to establishing a good branding online and also if you've learned two new things today subscribe to my channel because I love teaching and this is a free way that you can support me to continue to do that now that you've created your branding steps four and five is the implementation phase with your brand voice this is a combination of a bunch of things who you are talking to what do you sound like to the them what's your tone what are the words you say what are the words you don't say what emojis do you use what emojis do you not use I use a different brand voice depending on who I'm talking to so if I'm trying to sell my TMI course which is the modern influencer course for Instagram influencers I'm saying things like do you want to chase your dreams and land those dream brand collabs like let's get to it babes you know like come on gal so that's kind of like my branding for Instagram influencers let's get this course blah blah blah blah blah but my tone for the bsp model because that's more of a professional a toz road map my tone does not sound like that I'm talking professionally to content creators who want to take their online presence as serious as possible and build it as a business so I'll say things like if you're a content creator that's ready to establish your brand online and build a sustainable presence that brings consistent income da D D D D D so the vo is a little bit different depending on who I'm talking to of course when you get started out you just want to pick one tone so people can get to know you as that one thing and then you're going to use that tone everywhere online in your bio in your captions if you have a website on your website and try to get as clear as possible with the phrasing that you say and the phrasings that you don't say when I hired my content creator managers and my community managers we talked about words I say words I don't say emojis I use and emojis I don't use so I don't say boss babes or I don't say go shine and let's shine through life I don't know there's certain phrases that we talked about not using I also like don't cuss I'll be like what the fart or like what the flip you know that's kind of my phrasing and then we talk about emojis too I gave them a guide of emojis that I use and emojis that I would never use and then of course your content this is what you're creating and putting out to the world I like to narrow this down to content pillars so the three to five subtopics that you rotate talking about online and this is really going to establish you in a specific industry and you can really establish yourself as an authority in those topics alone so when I was starting out my focus was Instagram I wanted to be the Instagram coach and so the subtopics that I'd rotate talking about was how to take photos how to pose in photos how to grow on Instagram how to increase engagement on Instagram and how to land brand collabs on Instagram that was what I was continuing to talk about and because I was consistent with all of my branding with how I showed up with colors and my voice and how I taught because I showed up consistently within my brand parameters the quicker my audience and the public started to see me in a very specific way so if you can show up consistently within your brand parameters and your audience can start perceiving you the exact way you want them to to then that means your intention and the audience's perception has finally fallen into alignment so after you set up your amazing powerful brand what now what do you do next next you're going to watch this video here where I teach you the one thing that you need to do to unlock your social media growth whether it's YouTube Instagram or Tik Tok this is the video that's going to help you Skyrocket your reach so thank you so much for watching I will see you in the next one follow your joy bye

Media,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91D5hjMEADg,"there's an unspoken question in every person's mind that has to First be answered why should I listen to you and I think it influences how people share how people take your content everything it's the frame that the content is consumed in you have to do things so that you have evidence that you can support why you are good and so I think it's really speaking on your truths rather than claiming to know the truth hey here's what I did versus here's what you should do feel the difference I broke it into three sections to make more sense so section one is why did I do this to begin with two what how and how much like what do we do to actually create that and then third is observations so quick backstory I'm going to go through this as fast as possible this is me when I started my business career sleeping on the floor I signed my first lease slept on that floor for the first nine months was able to uh get it to that picture on the left in a year then I opened a new location every 6 months after that and then over the next 18 months I met Lila and we did gym turn around so we basically fly from place to place to place and fill gyms up but it was a Hands-On sales model I had at our Peak eight sales guy tur around eight gyms every month that became tenuous logistically and we're like I wonder if there's a better way and so from there we packaged our IP for a better gym model into a licensing business and so we were able to grow gym launch which is a B2B business to two and half million bucks a month Prestige to 1.7 a month which is B2B Toc that was an affiliate based business and it was weight loss and supplements so e-commerce then we scaled Allen to 1.6 million a month which was B to B Toc and we just recently sold that for 46.2 and we just sold that one last year as well which I'm not not allowed to say the number but there you go then we started acquisition. comom which right now does about 13 million a month so right now we grow $3 million plus Internet businesses into 30 million doll plus sellable businesses that's kind of what we do now and so hopefully you're probably asking this question which is like what does this have to do with growing video or growing with video [Applause] Jack um but I started making video content with three goals so number one was to attract uh internet business owners doing $3 million or more who align with our values uh number two is to help all businesses below our minimum deal size to just grow to the deal size that was kind of the the idea like how do I just get everybody who's at a million to three million or 100K to 3 million whatever just get everybody up above that level so we can hopefully work with them um and then three to create a place where I could document each you the best practices of building worldclass companies from my experience and like we're not the Elon musks and the boses and and all that but I wish that those guys had documented what they had done like how cool would it have been to see like the Vlog of Amazon in 1996 right how sick would that have been and like every day he like yep almost lost the company today like 6 months later almost lost the company again like I thought that would have been awesome so I thought you know I didn't I did a really poor job of documenting everything up to this point and so I was really committed to like all right for this next phase um I really want to do a better job of it so that's the idea lo and behold businesses doing $3 million or more um started reaching out to us which was awesome right success so I guess this might have something to do with video uh but believe me when I say that no one is surprised as me about this kind of organic stuff in general because I've never done it before so we're on this ride together all right so here's the goal for the presentation give you a few lessons that I've learned to take you from wherever you are to a little closer to wherever you want to go with this presentation I'm so good at content there's the little man okay great so disclaimer again never done this I also didn't want to be famous or known for a very long time there's me saying I want to be rich not famous but several experiences changed my mind so I'll walk you through this really quickly so when Kylie do you remember this when Kylie was announced that she was a billionaire well that's what I felt like that day um I was like what am I doing wrong and then the rock you know killing it and then boom he's got a $2 billion plus uh tequila brand if he was able to launch off his organic audience Conor McGregor 600 million with proper 12 it's probably grown by since now Huda now is a billion dollar brand and so I can be a little slow sometimes but I could kind of read the writing on the wall uh so there's the writing on the wall um but I didn't want to build an e-commerce brand because all those were e-commerce physical products Brands and I was like H it's not my vibe I already did that once it's not like it's not my favorite of the businesses that we've done so I still kind of like dragged my feet a little bit and that's when I heard this guy Nomad capitalist who like teaches people to not be US citizens that's not the point but um so you can not pay taxes but anyways um that's when I heard a podcast with this guy and he was like oh yeah I get about 3,000 applications a month I was like holy canol I was like well if I had 3,000 applications a month I would make at least $1 if that were my life and so I realized it could work for B2B not just e-commerce stuff I was like that's neat and then I heard Neil Patel was doing 100 million bucks a year doing a B2B agency Services all off inbound I was like okay this might make sense and so again I still was like all right so it does work for B2B organic stuff works but I still didn't really want to be famous that was not my vibe and so I met up uh with dear friends of ours uh Lisa and Dean graos and we had a conversation that was kind of last straw here so I was like dude being famous sounds terrible he was just telling us about how like somebody like shut up his house and threaten his kids and I was like that sounds awful like why no no no thank you I'm good I'll just pass on grass and so he's like if getting harassed and attacked is the price I have to pay for the it's supposed to say [Laughter] impact that was perfect um for the impact that I want to have then I'd pay that price every time which totally takes away from the impact of that message um but I was like he's right you know what I mean like he said if if if if that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have and I pay that price every time I like all right I need to I need to stop being all right so 18 months ago I started a YouTube channel some of you guys may have anybody seen this the YouTube channel mosy nation and so I built two expensive Studios to launch this thing um I started making three videos a week uh side note import lesson that I learned on a vacation uh that really one did better than my really fancy one which then taught me that what's inside the content matters more than the rapper So for anybody who's like worried about getting started about making it look right I don't think it matters I mean I think it matters a little bit but it's 8020 so focus on the 80 all right and so I continued my very steady growth for for that period of time which is great recommend um but you know in the first 12 months we went from 600 to 70,000 subscribers which was cool um and so things were going smoothly until one day I had to chat with Grant Cardone about branding and it reminded me that all the lessons that I learned in business applied to all this organic stuff and so I was on this call with him and I have the full video on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out um yeah he was like bro I'm not even going to try he was like bro pull up your Instagram and I was like okay he's like pull up my Instagram he's like I got 10 times the content is you 10 times he's like bro it's volume bro volume and um I was like that's deep um and so I was like you know I should probably do more uh which is a lesson that I have learned over and over and over again in business and I'll tell you a coup more story about later uh but like so many times we're doing the right stuff we're just doing way way too little of it like I'll tell you a quick story which is not on this presentation but when I started my first gym I was told that I should put flyers out and so I went uh you know I'm like really you know full of piss and vinegar I was like I'm going to go do it so the business owner told me had was more successful me Etc and so I went I put the Flyers out and then like nothing really happened so I met back up with him a few weeks later and he was like hey how the Flyers work and I was like uh you know I got one guy who called me and said IED up his car um that was it he's like well what was your test size I was like hm uh I was like well I mean I put 300 out and he was like dude our test size is 5,000 he's like that's what we test with he's like and then we do 5,000 a day I like oh noted and so it was just a really good lesson and that happens with phone calls like yeah I'm doing I'm going to I'm going to start doing cold calls you make 10 calls every 3 days when you're feeling motivated rather than doing 200 aisles every day like it's Clockwork before lunch you know what I mean the level of effort difference is not like 2X or 4X it's like 50x it's a lot bigger and most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume and effort that is required to get to where you want to go like dramatically and so those I've so many lessons that this repeated and I was taught yet again in a different sphere that I'm not familiar with that this was true I'm also wearing the same shirt um so I decided to take his viice and dramatically increase the amount of content that we created and how many places we displayed it right and so before I tell you um who wants to guess how many pieces of content we started putting out weekly after that call 25 10,000 less than that I would be so much more famous if I put 10,000 out what was that 100 good good guess so we went from seven pieces of content a week I did three on YouTube and then I just repurposed the same three on a podcast um to 80 80 content pieces a week and for scale if you remember the first line that I showed you way before the top of that is that purple line from the first graph I showed you and so pretty pretty cool and so this is what happened in those 6 months we uh added 300,000 subscribers on YouTube 7,000 followers on Instagram still haven't really cracked that one uh 350,000 on Tik Tok 150,000 buyers which is cool uh on Amazon on for the book uh 350,000 followers on Instagram 100,000 on uh Twitter and 400,000 downloads a month on the podcast cool right so basically aund a million person audience uh within that six months and because I am more of a business guy than I am a quote influencer Creator uh this is what I cared about so the net traffic result for us was web traffic went from basically non-existent to about 100,000 uh unique clicks a month to the site just organically pretty cool uh number two is the subscribers I told you before and then this is one that's really cool for who here runs paid ads can I get a okay some of you cool so this this will resonate with you so in the businesses that I had at a $25 CPM we were getting $2 million a month in exposure for free not only not free we're getting paid to do it crazy like I'm I'm beside myself still because I think it's insane so the fact that this opportunity exists right now is literal insan me like we're getting paid now to Market like what a world right and so the business result from that is that we get about 400 companies a month that apply for acquisition. comom uh so we can help them scale um and in that time period We Grew From 7 million a month to 13 million a month um and disclaimer on that is that part of that was just the the companies themselves grew wasn't like new companies um but still a lot in six months and so if you're anything like me you're probably thinking well that's really great for you Alex but what about me which is why I made section two which is how and how much all right so here's where you come in all right so let's start with how much so just a reminder here in terms of time I'm not like a Creator full-time so it's like 937 is probably the amount of time that I allocate towards this and so MoneyWise this cost me $20,000 a month to do all right you can scale this down however you want I also don't have a tremendous amount of time that I allocate towards it so I have to compensate with that with money you could probably do this on your own I just I this is how I do it so so we have a Twitter editor a YouTube editor a LinkedIn editor a podcast editor and an IG and Tik Tok editor all right um and there's two of us so times two so it's actually 40,000 a month for the both of us okay the amount of time that it takes me is two days uh per month and four hours per week uh and that is that is what I dedicate towards this and so quick recap I have a daily mind dump which I'll show you how I do it in a second because we're going to show you I'm going to show you the whole model um I do a weekly Twitter review it takes me like four hours because Twitter is actually really important to how I do all this stuff which I'll explain later and if you guys aren't on Twitter I actually it's my favorite platform but um we do one day a month of recording and then uh for shorts and then one day a month uh it's usually like a half day I'll do like four to eight YouTube videos the ones that are direct to camera and that's it that's the that's the jam so that's the how much that's what that's my investment that's my cost to do this and so here's the how and so this is the content creation model all right that's the big Visual and those are the Bold bullets fantastic let's start with with the first one so test record inject contextualize distribute so the old way that I used to do content was I would just have this ongoing email thread to myself I don't you guys have like notes or like a chain to yourself because you probably get ideas you're in a conversation oh I should make a piece of content on that right and then you email it to yourself and that's how I did it for a long time and the new way is the Twitter way which is uh being blocked by the thing because it formatted weird but uh I post all of those ideas as tweets on Twitter rather than just sending them to myself and so all of a sudden what used to be my inbox is actually just my like tweet thread all right and so I tweet about five times a dayish uh and the nice thing is that Twitter is a very forgiving platform so it's just like stream of Consciousness and it takes notes you don't have to pick vid you know videos or captions or I like it because it's just thoughts like that's I love Twitter so much for that reason and so I'll post this stuff and I'll be like okay those are the ones that people thought were interesting and then the threads become long format and the shorts become short format or the tweets become short format pretty simple step one everyone following with me so long yeah my man any we feel like you could do that all right doable yes second step is recording right why am I doing both I realized this because you're like why you do short stuff um I was kind of against shorts and then I realized that I've never actually consumed anything from Gary ve that's long but I like Gary ve a lot and I was like ah well I guess that work so that's why I do both uh right and so I think it's a width and depth thing I think the shorts give you a lot of breath I think the Longs give you a lot of depth right and so there's a visual that I put together that took me too long to to say that same thing great so this is everything that I know about about how to make content that quote goes viral I watched a long like interview with Mr Beast my big practice of trying to learn stuff is go to the person who's the best at it and listen to them because they've already reorganized the information for you hack um and so he's like listen all these guys make this all compliment with their tags and the hashtags and if any of you guys sell that this is not me offending you I have no idea what I'm talking about remember big grain of salt um but he said it's just CTR times watch time that's it you got to get people to click and you got to get people to watch I was like okay that makes sense he's like and that's what YouTube wants they want people to be interested in the content to get the click and then make sure that the content fulfills the promise of the thumbnail cool I was like I can do that and so this is the general format that I've used for the Longs which is like a hooker question that I'm answering usually a story that's relevant to answer the question a framework that I've applied to repeat that process and then an explanation of why I think it works that's it and if I want to make longer stuff it's just that process with multiple stories repeating that over and over again the shorts is a hooker question a hammer which for me is my tweet I put the Tweet as the next thing I say because I already know it converts um and then I have an example on an explanation that's about it that's Alex's million doll thing there we go fantastic and so this is an example so it's like 28 ways to guarantee poverty or 28 ways to stay poor right so I made this thread got a lot of shares cool 208 rules reprogram mind to be rich in 22 minutes so I have to change the the you know the headline and stuff but the content was identical I just did it in a video right and then the short ones that do well it's like all right overheard from an ABC blah blah blah authenticity is just a fancy word boom I just make a short version of the same thing just saying the Tweet does this make sense yes okay cool and then I upload it fancy so far all right Tada next one is inject so uh we grew the the podcast actually recently from like 20,000 a month to 400,000 a month and a big part of that was just having called to actions um sounds really dumb but I wasn't doing it so do it and so the way that we did it was we recorded two versions of each of the call to action so like call to action to other channels lead Medics share a tag if you have a lower ticket product I don't but like or if you know for me I guess have a book it's 99 sense um you know leave a review uh if you want to ask for clients or you know send a question or there's my book there Grant slam offer so I would just record two different ctas for that and then I just inject them into the content so this is what what it might look like so it's like you have your cta1 content mid roll content uh end off does that make sense so we started doing that with the podcast and it's it started to grow a lot and now we're actually doing it in the rest of the forms of content so you'll see that from me uh because this has been working uh so this is me doing this walking the talk all right the point directions Etc okay contextualize so anyone seen this one before everyone see this like me that went viral so it's like everybody kind of appears somewhat differently even though it's the same person depending on the setting that you're in right on Facebook you look a certain way LinkedIn you look a certain way Tinder you look a certain way um I had a sales guy who uh was on this is not relevant at all um was on Tinder and uh and he would close every one of his dates uh on buying our supplements um so that he could get he was like it always covered dinner um Savage anyways um just you know Shooters got to shoot okay so so you have to make the stuff contextual and so this is what we do so this is the same video right it's that same uh Navy SEAL video I made earlier right so that's a real that's a Tik Tok and then that's the YouTube short so it's the same thing you just you just make it match the platform same way you would make your Facebook look different than your Instagram look different than your LinkedIn Etc as long as you just make it contextual I think it it does a lot better because have you guys seen people just like take literally the exact same thing and post it on the wrong platform I just think it just hurts it and it's just not that much effort to to make it contextual all right last one distribute then we distribute them all right so we went from seven times a week to 80 times a week in distribution that was the result over that six-month period which is a lot of growth awesome and so we 10x the inputs and we got 10x the outputs surprising right so who here would like 10 times the output well then you can just 10x the input all right good talk um so quick recap all right content creation model test first thing you do make your brain dump into something that's actually generating content so this T this is net zero time for me I was doing it and I just started doing it publicly number two is that once I have the stuff that's winning I record it I record the threads as Longs I record the tweets of shorts from there the team injects the call to action so that I can direct the traffic whatever way I want to direct it right four and big one on this last injection thing like if you don't do this because I wasn't it you you get all of these Impressions and like eyeballs and stuff and you'll get followers but like you don't drive a result um which again sounds silly that I wasn't doing this but I told you at the beginning you guys are better than I am at this number four was contextualize it I just think it works a lot better and then finally you cut it and increase the volume cool that makes sense so far great fantastic so was that helpful Okay cool so that concludes section two how much and how fantastic observations I was going to call it musings but then I thought no one would know what that meant so um I just gave you the like traditional lip service on a Content generation model it's kind of boring and I don't think it's that interesting which is why I tried to get through it quickly because a lot of people describe that as the reason that we grew a lot and I don't think that's why but I'm presenting it because I would end up getting a zillion questions about it and so that's why it's there well I hope you are enjoying today's session and I wanted to let you know that if you are loving content like this then you definitely need to go to 21v video tips.com where you can actually get 21 more video marketing tips just like this from industry experts like Patrick B David Vanessa Lao Pat Flynn and Alex heroi

to get instant access for free and learn how you can level up your business and brand that's 21 videot tips.com now let's get back into today's content I think the real reason that we were able to grow so I'm going to put like my real head on for a minute um is that and again this is my two cents there you go is that there's an unspoken question in every person's mind that has to First be answered which is why should I listen to you and I think it's one of the most profound questions and I think it influences how people share how people take your content everything it's the frame that the content is consumed in so I'll give you a real world example imagine you're talking to a guy you don't know anything he's just like talking about business and you're like oh that's cool and then like two seconds later it's like dude that guy's a billionaire all of a sudden you're like right the frame matters a lot Elon Musk makes a a tweet that's like I'm on the toilet and it gets like 500 million shares right this guy's hilarious right it's because it's Elon right and he has a brand that he's established and there's context there and so I think that we should have this question answered for ourselves and our prospects before creating content all right and so imagine for a moment that had done this whole presentation up to this point and I had a 1,000 person total audience between all of those platforms same presentation how different would that feel right just imagine dude on stage you don't know me and I have a thousand people on Instagram and that's it same presentation you would receive it differently right right I would cuz I would think it was stupid pointless preachy better than now full of and if you're so good why don't you do it that's what I would think right and so we have to answer the question why should I listen to you and I think a lot of you are making content from a weak frame and that's just what I see that's just me witnessing it like you know it's like the 18-year-old relationship coaches you know what I mean they're they're real you know like they're out there some of you are here you like being real right you know or it's like the business coaches that are doing $5,000 a month I don't you know I mean I don't have a lot of like you know so besides all the stuff that we shared earlier the real reason that I think our audience is growing is that we're talking about stuff that we have evidence to support like that's the real right so all the I said earlier sure you can do that that worked for me you might not like Twitter I like Twitter because it's easy for for me if it's not easy for you don't do it right which is why this worked for me this time right that's the context but I think this stuff is the more kind of Eternal stuff and that's why I was kind of like excited to get to part three uh yes uh and so I think it's about having the evidence for your others and most importantly for yourself right we built these other companies first before ever talking about how to build companies right and so if you're like great Alex nice for you so how do I make content if I'm just starting out excellent question so there's two frame shifts that I think have to occur do then talk how I versus how to and give versus get all right so let's start with the first one so who here hates this right how to live an amazingly happy life and get everything that you want from somebody who is doing this parttime and is still cutting hair right there's nothing wrong with cutting hair but it probably wouldn't make you an authority on this matter does that make sense some of you are doing this and wondering why it's not working like man my stuff's so much better it honestly doesn't matter it doesn't matter because if I had a thousand people on state like on my followers and I made the same presentation you wouldn't give it like I'm trying like real right and so there's a better way I think all right so this is Alex's crazy content creation model trademark pending all right step one do step two talk about what you just did I know and then do bigger this is a complex model I know we're getting to it so here's how it looks in the real world all right hey here's what I did versus here's what you should do feel the difference this is what I did if it works for you awesome if it doesn't work for you no sweat here's 20 of my clients this is the stuff that I'm doing with them right now Rosie was struggling with some skin condition we started giving her magic pills and look at her skin now it's amazing right but like this is what it might not work for you but this is what work for her and this will work for him and this will work for my clients right not what you should do as soon as you point out people hate you because it sounds like you're preaching it sounds like you have an ego and I just don't think people like that and so I think it's also switching from how I I other way switching from how to to how I so how to build a massive social media following to how I built the following that I have feel a difference it's really small but really big in terms of how people interpret your message because it's like thanks I appreciate it I think that what happens is when you say it that way you're like you're you're you're pulling back and saying like hey like I hope this serves you in some way like this is like me opening the kimono this is stuff that's working right now for me whereas the other way you're at the pulpit commanding giving demand you know demands and and commanding people and I just don't think people like that I mean how many people their entire Instagram femous people shaking their finger at you right it sucks I hate it right and so I think it's really speaking on your truths rather than claiming to know the truth and I think the here and there's a there's a point I probably make later but I'll bring it up now is that everyone is unquestionably an expert on your own life no one can question that if I say I had oatmeal for breakfast this morning I am untouchable I was kind of lame but but from the from a factual like no one can challenge me on that like this is what I eat every day no one's going be like you Alex like harming the planet right they're not going to say that because like that's real that's true no one can touch that right but as soon as I say you should have oatmeal for breakfast you right it's this big of a difference but it makes all the impact in the world in terms of how people receive the message so question who here makes the content because they want to become famous and feel good about themselves oo well who here is making stuff because they want it to be received and help the audience right and so the thing is is you have to feed them and not you and I think if you can make that shift I think in my opinion it will be more effective and so if you look at the biggest influencers in the business space because this is the space that I'm kind of in you look at these guys I mean shoot half these guys are talking here so congrats to the the event it's awesome very honored to be on stage with them um so that's the accm at work the Alex crazy content creation method at work by the way um do talk about the you did which one of these guys made money from their social media following made the money they have from the social media following right and so how many of these people needed the followers none right people like I want to be the next this it's like if you want to be the next that then you got to walk that walk right and so you probably won't be respected as an authority on business until you've achieved Mega success the same reason you look at your competitors like that guy sucks it's like they're looking at you right and it's because why should I listen to you and so here's the good news because you're like well Alex what do I talk about here's the good news you can become a niche specific Authority so rather than going like here's how to live an amazing life right that's like you've got to be Jesus Jesus can do that Jesus can you can't do that Jesus can do that right so you got to go from here to like I'm really good at helping people build ATM businesses I'm really good at help people flip houses in Phoenix right because in that little ocean that little Pond you can be king because you got to compete against 20 guys and you got to do you got to walk the talk right you got to do what you're doing you talk about what you're doing that's it but you can win in that little Pond and I'll show you how to scale from there in a second but you can do that all right and so this is me when I started so I had a couple power lifting records and I liked working out right and so thank you and so the stuff that I did then was about what I was doing then and so you you can't read it but it says how to get rid of stubborn fat on your arms and stomach that's the content I was making then and who was it relevant for just the members at my gym but that was my way of adding value and I already had rapport with them so they're like if I'm going to learn about this identical topic from 100 different people I'd just rather learn about it from you because I like you and I had values based po not expertise like I had General expertise cuz I looked the way I looked but beyond that I didn't have a PhD it's not like I did a ton of research I read the same articles and just tried to make it entertaining that was it and I didn't become me mega famous for that but this made me money this made me enough money to you know grow the company that I had at the time and so from there I leveraged that to grow my first gym and then the gyms after that right and then from there once the gyms grew I started making content about how to grow gyms why CU I how to grow gyms I wasn't like how to scale your SAS company you know I mean like how to reach a billion dollar valuation like I I was like I don't know but this is what worked for my gyms and people are like dude this stuff works I'm like I know because I'm doing I this is how I do it like I know it works this is how I do it of course it I'm doing it here's what's crazy so many people are talking about and teaching stuff that a they have never done and B they are repurposing someone else's content and making a version of it some of them are [Applause] you and that's the thing is is like when you start talking the theoretical and trying to teach something it's how to rather than how I right so if you do the thing then you just talk about what you just did now later on I think it's the the capture uh don't create document don't create concept but I understand that that takes resources like it takes money to get people around you to you know document your life and all that kind of stuff like that that's expensive but I think just even doing Recaps of like this is the stuff that's working right now for us in this context people are like thanks you didn't have to do that thanks for sharing that stuff that's working for you rather than how to and no if you do it that way you will not gain a mega following at first but you will accomplish which will set you on the path for you to be broader later so the gym Secrets podcast became the game then I published from the gym launch Secrets book which is how to build a profitable gym to $100 million offers book and the difference in scale was pretty tremendous that's my Jim Secrets book but I still think it's a phenomenal book by the way um to that book and that book's done that in less than a year and that other book's been out like four years and so it's not bad it's just sequence people try and go out of sequence they try and say like why am I not Tom Billy you why can't I'm doing everything Tom Billy is doing except for building Quest oops like that's why what he says is relevant right like you know what I mean because the thing is is like we want everybody here most people seek truth would you say if you're like raise your hand if you seek truth okay so the easiest shortcut for the brain to seek truth is to look at someone who's the most extreme version and then think okay I don't have to apply a lot of decision-making filtering here because now I can just absorb this because I I can just take this as fact because if Warren buffit says this is how I should invest I feel okay about that Source even if he's like save your money spend less than you earn in dollar cost average into the S&P and don't buy gold right like he says that stuff and you're like okay now the stay-at-home teacher who's been saving all of her money could say the exact same thing but she just forgot to build Berkshire hathway and so the thing is is that and I'm I'm actually very against the whole confidence Mantra of like people being like you got to believe in yourself you got to you have to do things so that you have evidence that you can support why you are [Applause] good you guys are great and this is like my favorite line from The Matrix it's I think in the second or third I can't remember which one it is but Morpheus is up there and he's like I feel truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before me because of the path that lies behind me and I think I think it gives a lot of spiritual strength that because I I got asked on an interview they're like how are you so certain I was like you talk about these things like with so much certainty I was like well that's just how I've done it like and it's that depth of experience and knowledge that like no one can question that we built those things that's truth those are the real numbers and so as long as you're not fudging your numbers right and you just say like this is what it is then of course you're [Â __Â ] certain right because I think confidence is self-d delusion it's trying to make up for what you don't have evidence for and I think it's a much easier practice to stop pretending and start doing the stuff that you should be certain about and then you don't have to have bravado you can get up like you can walk on stage and people are like that guy built the big the biggest king and water Empire out there my Budd Colin's in the front and and he built that he doesn't have to have confidence for people to listen to him they will want to listen to everything that he says if that is what they want to do because they'll just go to the person that's done the thing that they want to do so that they don't have to apply a lot of effort in thinking and they can just say I'll do everything this person says right most people cannot separate information from source so what we do is we just seek out good sources I think wisdom is built through being able to take from separating information from source a fool can give you a very wise piece of wisdom or information or a lesson but it's much harder to do that and so the shorthand for most of us is just go to somebody who's an absolute Authority in this thing that has unquestionably a reason that I should listen to them and then just listen to them the downfall of that is that you start taking stock advice from your hairdresser I'm not bashing hairdressers right now that's just top of mind right and so you're like I trust you what else you got and then they start talking about things that are not their expertise and then that's when you get in trouble and so to the same degree if you probably have an audience that start asking you questions right anybody have an audience to ask some questions raise your hand okay if someone asks you a question that is not something that you have authority on I think you gain more Authority by saying I don't have authority to speak on that and then you gain more respect because because this is what happens damaging admissions are the single greatest thing that built trust if I say I I suck at marriage advice I suck at you know giving happiness advice I suck at whatever but I'm really good at making high returns in the stock market how much more believable that is that than I make really good returns in the stock market and I'm really good at marriage and I'm really and and and when you admit your deficits whatever comes after the admission of guilt or the admission of of deficiency is believed more so if I say hey I really suck at a lot of things but you're going to believe what I S I say right here that's a sentence structure for persuasion and you can use that in all of the content that you have forever it's also great for negotiating and so anyways I say all this to say it's the path that lies behind you not the path that lies in front of you that will give you the certainty that you want to gain the influence you desire and so my Evolution for me was Fitness First and I just talked about this is what's worked for me people are like Alex how do you eat Twizzlers and cookies all day and have a six-pack and I'm like a genetics B I live at a gym and see I eat this way right and people are like oh so I can have cookies too and have a sixpack and I was like yes and that was relevant for me some people are like super vegan Superstars awesome and they're going to talk about what's relevant for them and the people who follow will be like that's I I Vibe with that cool right and so I'm not going to be the best nutrition expert in the world but in terms of like my little little fum I can rule that right and then I moved up because I started doing well there and people started asking me hey how are you growing your gym I was like well this is how I grow my gym people were like what about business in general like I don't know I've never R an e-commerce business I don't know about manufacturing I don't know about software I don't know about any of that stuff but I know how to grow a gym so I only talks about that and the amount of people that that was relevant for this many but for that audience everything right I mean and just for context here there are riches and niches like that company made a lot of money um just saying like it made a lot of money and it didn't make me famous at all and so again the question is do you want to be rich do you want to be famous are you're trying to serve you you're trying to serve the audience right and then the last one is like now we've been able to leverage that initial success to build an e-commerce brand to build a software brand to sell those and then now we have a portfolio and so now because we have businesses that span a lot of different areas I can say these are the Frameworks that we used to build all of them I hope this serves you and then people can take that and has anybody used any of the Frameworks that we've for mosy nation anybody who's been there have anybody used those Frameworks to make more money one person probably [Laughter] not so a big part of that is that you just get better over time and so I said this quote and it went it it got shared a lot it's it's like you're not making as much money as you want cuz you're not as good as you think you are I'm just being real like I don't know I could have done like the here's my 177,000 content model you know what I mean but like the real is that you're probably not that good yet comma and that's okay like the only person beating you up is you right and so the only way to get better is volume and the only way to get even better than volume is volume times time because volume you can write this down I don't have this in the presentation but this is like the equation of Life Volume or at least business volume times time equals skill you got to do it a lot of times for a long period of time and you will get better that is a promise you will if you suck today you will suck less tomorrow and eventually one day you will look up and suck so little that you will actually be good and then people will ask you how did you become an overnight success and then instead of saying here's how you cold call you say here's how I did it I hope this serves you right and you can build that trust that way great Alex so how do I make money if I'm just starting out fantastic all right colon gez always about the money I'm kidding C's awesome um so here's a couple observations here give away the secrets sell the implementation all right if you want to build an Enterprise that is valuable this is how you do it you can sell info there's nothing wrong with that but if you want to build a brand give away the secret sell the implementation all right because people like you can give the whole Farm away people still won't do it 1% of people will do it my business model relies on the 1% who do it you I mean so like I I Bank on that but only 1% are do it so most people need help most people need encouragement most people need accountability most people need somebody who's going to act as their virtual Google because they don't want to type it in it's true right and so one of the side notes that I have here is that if you're not afraid of what you're giving away that you're giving away too much you're not giving away enough and so every time I've written a book or I've made like a presentation that ends up going live I always think to myself like oh God I'm sharing everything what will they do they won't need me anymore cuz I give them this information they can they don't they'll just keep living their lives and I will become obscure and nothing and I will and I will die right that is what it feels like I mean you you catastrophize but but that's real right it's the it's the opposite though right and there's so many things I feel like that I that I've at least realized for me is a lot of things are the opposite of what you expect it's like you only gain your life by giving it right like you only get trust from others by trusting first you only get value back by giving value first and so if you're afraid of giving away all the secrets that you have I promise you if you make content that does not contain the secrets 99% of people who are the people who are never going to pay you anyways 99% of people will just think you suck because you give nothing so you just make fluff because you're so afraid of giving good stuff away that the thing that most people consume is they make one they consume one video and they make a judgment and say I will never consume a video from this person again what a waste of time and so like my big fear with every piece of content is I would rather make fewer pieces of content because I'm so afraid of somebody taking 20 minutes to consume something after watching a bunch of my stuff watching that one and not actively deciding to stop watching but just just don't get enough for the time that they're like I'll just watch something else they don't say like a Alex they just pivot a little bit and slowly you fade away and so I would rather have quality over quantity but quality quantity beats just just quality right but I would personally this is me I would personally prefer to have better stuff and give away as many Secrets as I possibly can to get people to start taking steps towards you because what also happens is if someone goes and uses stuff from the YouTube channel and grows from a million dollar a year to $3 million a year or million a year they don't have questions on whether or not we can provide value because we already have right and then it makes the sales process dramatically easier because you say what brought you here today and they're like well you made me $2 million a year I love you and you're like awesome want to get to 10 and they're like sure like how do I know it's going to work because it already has right and you can take that it's a totally different totally different frame for the sale okay and so make your free materials better than everyone else's paid materials I heard this from Tony Robbins and I think it's really true but I think the real real is that most of your stuff is not better than their paid stuff and so that's why it doesn't work and so talk about you really know which is your specialty which is your individual thing that you have experienced that no one can challenge your truth all right and so finally you want to play games where if you weight you win because Goodwill compounds faster than money because the longer you can delay the ask the bigger the ask can be the longer the runway the bigger the plane that can take off of it and so I promise you and this is again gigantic Himalayan grain of salt with the limited experience that I have uh doing organic because I've only done direct to jugular paid ads um cold calling you know affiliate stuff straight pitching I've only done that but I can say that this brand is very special to me because I enjoy what we're building and I'm in no rush to do it and you have time and so the longer you can wait and keep walking with people the longer the compounding works in your favor like it's no coincidence that the biggest people in the business space don't need anything from their audiences right because I think that that compounding process gets interrupted when you do a hard pitch that's my opinion I could be wrong that's my opinion and so the idea is how can we how can we sell without selling right and I think in that way the compounding will happen faster than the revenue would have otherwise increased if you started trying to make the money fast and so the longer you can delay that the better it's going to be and then you can understand why all these guys play the infinite game of never even wanting to do that right hook because it's like but next year I'm going to have five times the audience and then a year later they're like but next year I'm going to have five times the audience right because as soon as you you you you shoot your shot you dramatically decrease the Goodwill and so I think that I've at least adapted and this is maybe just a different way of saying it I know Gary's got uh jab jab jab right hook just a personal observation that I've had is that you can go give give give give give give get you don't even have to ask people just start handing things to you because if you deposit a enough Goodwill in there it just starts coming back and I know that sounds crazy but like the amount of people that DM me are like Hey man can I give you 10 grand for 10 minutes I'm like no I don't do that like about 20 grand like no I don't do that right the amount of times people inbound and they're like hey can I have you on my podcast can I have you on my stage can I all these things are happening because you're not asking for anything and it makes people feel uncomfortable it like it makes people feel really uncomfortable they're like how can I buy something from you you're like you can't they're like and I'm like use the get to 3 million then we can partner right but but that's it you know what I mean there's nothing else and so I think that if we can make that pivot and have that patience uh but like we're thinking really big picture the reason most people aren't successful is they just can't control themselves like that's it it's impulse control and so there's three things they did this research study that said that Ultra Su Ultra successful people have three common traits number one is they have a superiority complex they think they're better than everybody they think they they can do bigger things second is that they are they have crippling insecurity of not being enough I like that one hits me and then the third one is impulse control so so they know where they want to go they have a way they have a way drive to not be a failure and they stay focused on it because of impulse control and so the idea here is if we can do that we will be more successful F and the reason that most people don't make money is because they can't wait 12 months like I had this I have this 18-year-old who is my neighbor and I said I'm going to have you sign a contract that says I want to be a millionaire I was like you got to wait five years and you can't make any money between now and then would you do it he's like yeah I would do it every single person can do that I guarantee you if you delayed your ass for five years and you us to provide a value to people for five years you'd have bigger audience than you what to do with and you'd be a millionaire in five years probably happen a lot faster than that but if you committed to doing it for five years you would but guess what no one's gonna do it and that's why most people aren't successful and so like we come to these events and you have the models and all the stuff right but people still eat cookies when they're trying to lose weight and so it's a concept of local versus global which is there's a local benefit to eating cookies you feel better whatever the global benefit goes down though because you don't get the six-pack you want if that's the goal and you're counting macros you get the idea right and so most people cannot sacrifice local benefit for Global the sales guys don't want to put the the notes in the CRM even though that benefits the entire organization because it's a local cost right and so as a side note for operations for a business operation are supposed to bring Global benefit in excess of the local cost um and so when we're trying to achieve the things that you're trying to do right the local benefit is just make the ask fast the global benefit is the longer you can wait the bigger it can be and so for me I'm like why not wait as long as humanly possible so I'll I'll wrap this up speak from strength share your experiences to add to the body of knowledge the problem with a lot of the Social Media stuff and and books that are out there now is that the the barrier to entry in terms of what it takes to publish content is so low it's almost not visible right so low and so everybody can produce content back in the day the only way you produce content was like after 30 years of being a researcher you're like this is my entire life's work in one book so I can add to the body of knowledge people were like wow thank you for that and that's how that's how content was made right and if you wanted to do a direct uh you know a marketing piece you had to edit it and put it on a piece of paper and look at it every single way and know that you're going to pay 50 cents for every single person who's going to receive it and you better be damn sure it's beautiful right but people don't want like it's so easy now to to publish that most stuff is right most stuff sucks and is a total waste of time so just try and talk about the stuff that's not a waste of time that you actually know so you can add to the body of knowledge if you say hey this is what I did consider yourself a mini researcher like these are the experiments I ran in my business these are the experiments I ran in my weight loss clinic these are the experiments I ran in my Plumbing business just talk about the experience because no one can question that second is that teaching on principles is difficult until you've achieved a material amount the field because there are others who will teach it with more depth of experience it's very difficult to teach business unless you're very successful business because there's just another person who someone will listen to more right but no one can question what you have done and if you have done nothing then do something first and then talk about it because not everyone is an expert on everything but you are unquestionably an expert on your own life so you can share it"
4ajmfzj9G1g,"7 Effective Marketing Strategies for 2024 (TIPS, TRICKS & TACTICS)",Unknown,1034310,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ajmfzj9G1g/hq720.jpg,2022-06-04 00:00:00,1340,Adam Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ajmfzj9G1g,"- Hey there, my friend, Adam here. Today, I wanna share with
you seven marketing secrets or marketing hacks or marketing tricks, essentially things that
nobody's really talking about. Not even me that often. And it's because they're
a little more complicated and a little more nuanced than the quick hits that we often get when it comes to social media, things like post at this time, or adapt your content
for this algorithm tweak or use this kind of font
or this kind of color or all of those things. What I'd rather do is get to
the core of why your marketing may not be working as well as you want. And even if it is working okay, understanding the seven things that I'm gonna be walking
you through here today will allow you to immediately
upgrade all of it. Get better results, more
clicks, more traffic, more sales from everything you do. And not only that, probably the most important
thing that I could ever give you is to show you how to
think about your marketing, how to process different
marketing strategies and basically the crazy stuff
that goes on inside my head when I'm evaluating different
marketing tactics and tools and resources and all of that. So my goal here today is
as ambitious as it is, is to try to pack seven
secrets and seven hacks into a very short period of time, so that you're gonna
be able to watch this. And you're going to be able to extract these little golden nuggets and
apply them to your business, to your client's business, to whatever it is that you're doing. And it starts right now. So the very first thing
that we need to talk about is kind of what ends up
happening when someone says, ""Hey, my marketing's just not working. Like, it's just nothing's happening. No one's clicking. No one's watching my stuff. The algorithm isn't pushing
it or promoting it to people. Nothing's working."" It's something that I hear all the time. I see it in the comments
below very common. 90% of the time, it's because they're just
not doing enough marketing. It's just a question of volume. It's a question of quantity,
not so much quality. So let me explain. I don't know who's to blame for this one. Maybe it's the get-rich-quick things. Maybe it's all of the
courses and the programs that promise that you can
become a millionaire in 30 days with no work or whatever it is. But for some reason, when
people think about marketing, they think that all they need
to do is make a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad or
post one video on YouTube and they'll just blow up and become the next viral sensation and everything will just
work out miraculously well, and, seriously, I wish this was the case. That'd be amazing, but it's not, right. It's like marketing is
just a business function. I'm gonna make this sound horribly boring, but it's like accounting or finance or legal aspects of a
business or HR or sales or whatever it is. They're all just different
business functions, which means that they require time. They require energy. They require money and investment in them in order to get them to work. Now, what ends up happening is most people will make
one post on social media. It won't get the traction. And then they'll swear off that platform. So they'll hop over here, try out Twitter now and
make a couple tweets. Nobody engages. So they say, ""Well, Twitter doesn't work,"" and they'll make a YouTube video. And then that won't take
off and they get frustrated and they get angry because
it's just not working when the reality is, they
probably just haven't done enough. And that's why the first concept, the first sort of hacker secret is identifying the marketing sweet spot. So in the most rudimentary
art drawing class ever, let me show you exactly what I
mean by marketing sweet spot. And you can see where you fall and where the vast majority
of businesses fall. And if you find yourself in this position, you know that the answer is
to keep on pushing through. It's not to dial back. It's not to pivot. It's not to do anything like that. It's just to keep going forward. So lemme show you what that looks like. So I want you to imagine
for a second, a bell curve, kind of like the traditional bell curve. Of course, that'll be the, there we go. We'll get some ink flowing here. So this is our bell curve,
our ugly, ugly bell curve. And it's gonna have
three different sections. Now over here on the left, this is what you're going to call the minimum effective dose. So the MED, the minimum effective dose. Essentially, what ends up happening here is until you're in this
range, nothing you do matters. It's about sort of making
that one post on social media that someone sees one
time and then that's it. And then you wonder why it's not working. It's about spending $5 on
Facebook ads or Instagram ads and not getting immediate sales and then sort of swearing off the entire online
advertising system and that, but the reality is we just haven't hit the minimum effective dose. There's not enough momentum. There's not enough touch points. There's not enough exposures
and reach and engagement with the audience that
you're trying to reach. And we're gonna talk about
that one in just a second, but this is where 90% of businesses fall as they sit around here in
this minimum effective dose kind of half committing
to different strategies, and then wondering why nothing's working and the answer here,
the solution is, again, you've got to push through,
you've got to move up here. And this is the sweet spot. This is where you're going to find sort of the saturation of your market. You're going to be hitting
the number of touch points that are required. Again, we'll talk about
that in just a second. You're going to be making sure that the people that you want to reach are actually seeing your content. You're gonna make sure that
you've essentially saturated everything that you can. Now, the reality is this
sweet spot is huge, massive, massively huge. Like when we're thinking
about your business, your market or your industry, these are huge, huge industries, billions and billions of dollars. So unless your business is doing a billion dollars a year or more, there's more that you can do. It's crazy when I hear about
someone that thinks that, ""Well, look, I'm already posting
once a day on Instagram,"" or, ""I'm already making
one YouTube video a week,"" or, ""I've got a podcast. I'm pretty much maxed out. There's nothing else I can do."" And they're sitting at around,
say a million bucks a year, and they're in, let's
use health and fitness. So if you're in, let's say the health and fitness industry, this massive multi-billion dollar industry and your business is
doing a million a year, two million a year, a hundred
grand a year, whatever it is, you haven't even scratched the surface for what you're capable of doing and for the amount of
people that you could reach. So you could go from one post
a day to five posts a day. You could make one video on YouTube a week to one video on YouTube a day. You could do two videos a day. You could start other channels. You could have other podcasts. There's so much that you can do. Now, of course, at some point, you're going to reach this third area, which is diminishing
returns, biminishing returns. There we go, D for diminishing,
diminishing returns. There's gonna be some point
where eventually more money, more effort, more time
isn't gonna pay off, but I can't even begin to tell
you of all of the businesses I've worked with over the last 10 years, the tiniest fraction falls in here. And typically it's when they're spending like a million dollars a month on ads and they simply can't get
in front of more people with their ads. So they're doing blogging, they're doing podcasting,
they're doing SEO. They're running Google
ads and Facebook ads and Instagram ads and all that. The biggest example here is if you're running some
kind of search-based PPC, pay-per-click advertising,
like a Google search ad. At the end of the day, you can't make people
search for more stuff. So you can max out. But again, you can make that broader. You can go for discovery ad platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where you can put things
in front of people that may potentially be interested. There's a lot of ways. So the reality is, let's find a bright,
happy, colorful marker. This is where we're going
for, this sweet spot here. Like everybody is down here in this sort of minimum effective dose. They haven't even scratched the
surface for what's possible. And then they're wondering
why their marketing is not working. The best piece of advice of everything that I could give you here is, really, you just have to do more. Now, of course, you need to be strategic. You need to think through it. That's what the rest of
this is going to be about, but more is your answer. So on that note, how much more? And that leads me to the
marketing rule of seven. Now, depending on your business
or market or your industry, depending on if you're selling something for low-dollar value or high-dollar value, it's kind of universally agreed that for somebody to
make a purchase decision, for someone to take action
and actually buy from you, they need around seven touch points, which means seven engagements, seven interactions with your brand. You can't simply put something
in front of them one time, expect them to buy and then call it a day. You're gonna have to do
this multiple times, seven. Now, if it's expensive,
it's gonna be seven to 14. If it's significantly cheaper, like you're selling a pack of
gum for 99 cents or something, you probably don't need
seven touch points. One should be sufficient, but that rule of seven is important because it forces you to
not give up too early. It's just like when you're looking at these statistics around sales and you realize that most conversions, most closes for sales happen
after like five rejections or five follow ups, five
emails, five extra calls. It's rarely, pretty much
never, the first time. Same thing goes with marketing. A bit of a side note here, but marketing is kind
of selling one to many, sales is one to one,
marketing, one to many. So we use the same concepts,
the same strategies, all of that with sales. But I like to think of marketing
as a little more exciting and a little more challenging even because instead of trying to convince one person at a time and
overcome their objections and their fears and their concerns, we have to do this on mass and we have to do it without
really getting much feedback from our market. So rule of seven, that's important. Now, how do we do this? Well, we do this by showing up in front of our ideal target market where they're present and active, which means that we need to be selective about what social media
platforms we're going to, about what kind of content we're creating, about where we're putting that. And we need to make sure
that it's in alignment, not only with you and your content style and what you like doing, hate doing, but also where your people are. In fact, that's the
most important element. There's no point on being on
Twitter or Pinterest or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube if
your people aren't there. So you've gotta find out where they're present and active online, and then you've got to make
it your mission to follow up and to make sure that you're
consistently showing up in front of them with value,
with content, and with offers. So that's the marketing rule of seven. Now the next point is more of
a psychological phenomenon, more of a mental hack that you can use. I've talked about this a
ton on this channel here, but it's called the mere exposure effect and what the mere exposure effect is, is a psychological phenomenon that says we, as people, as humans, we associate frequency with trust. So the more often that we
show up in front of people, the more often that they see
us, the more they know us, the more they like us and
the more that they trust us. This kind of stems back to caveman days, where if we saw something enough times and it didn't try to kill us or eat us, we assumed it was safe. Well, all of that programming, all of that evolution is
carried forward to today. So now when we see things
again and again and again, we naturally start to like things more because we're familiar with them. They're less scary and, therefore, we're
more likely to trust them. So this is why the marketing
rule of seven is so important. This is why following up is so important. This is why making sure that you've got a solid
email marketing strategy in place is paramount. It's crucial. Probably the second most important
thing I could offer here, the first one is to make sure that you get out of that
minimum effective dose zone and into the sweet spot, by doing more. The second probably most
valuable piece of advice I could give you is to make sure that you're doing some
kind of email marketing and you're doing it more than you think. So for some weird reason, there's this rule, this
gospel in the marketing world, that you should send one
marketing email a week at most, maybe one a month, 'cause you
don't wanna bother people. Garbage. It's absolute garbage. There's plenty of
businesses and industries where you could send one
email every three days, you could send one email a day. There's some businesses and companies that I've consulted for and done work with and own and have stake in that do two emails a day and it works. People don't get angry,
they don't unsubscribe. You've just got to know
who your market is. At the very least, however, I'd say that you should be
shooting for three emails a week, kind of at minimum. Otherwise, again, you're
not going to have the chance to establish yourself and to take advantage of
all of those touch points and the marketing rule of seven and the mere exposure effect. And that leads me perfectly
to the next kind of secret, which is that you really wanna
go deep rather than broad. So let me tell you what is
probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to marketing. And that's whenever I ask somebody, ""Well, who's your target market?"" And they say, ""Everyone,"" or ""People with money,""
and that's amazing. That'd be great, but there's like eight
billion people on the planet. And I promise you, you
don't want all of them. Even if they all wanted
to do business with you, some of them are just
terrible, terrible fits for your business. So why don't we rein that in a little bit. And even if we were to say
separate men and women, well, now, we're down to like four billion or then we separate to this country. Now we're down to like a hundred million and then maybe this area,
now we're down to 30 million. I mean, still, we're gonna
wanna carve that down to a significantly lower number, someone that you're going
to be able to connect with on a deeper level. So the easiest way to do this is to take a look at
yourself and your business. Now I appreciate you
are not your customer. You know things that they don't know, you have experiences that they don't have. However, most people,
when it comes to business, they're solving a problem
that they had at some point. They're solving something
that they know about, that they care about, that they want to share
and help other people. So you probably understand a
little bit about your situation and what they're going through, and, therefore, you're more
likely to attract people similar to you. It's another kind of same reason that if you are a personal
brand or a coach or consultant or someone like that, you
tend to attract people, give or take 10 years around your age. So if you're 30, you'll
attract like 20 to 40. If you're 40, you'll attract
30 to 50, whatever it is. There's like this 20-year sliding scale, 10 years on each side that tends to work, that can balloon out a
little bit here and there. But on average, you'll
find most of your people fall in that range. Again, it's just because
you relate to them better. You know the words that they use, you grew up in the similar time, you have the same references,
all of that stuff. But the point is you want to go deep here and you wanna make better
connections with fewer people than these superficial
surface level connections with a ton of people. The big reason here is
because when you go broad, when you go after everybody, you're forced to naturally
water down your message. It becomes more vanilla,
it becomes more bland. And it has to, because
if you are being specific about someone's unique
pains and unique problems, well, it wouldn't be
appealing or interesting to, like, everybody else. So, therefore, you have to make it broad. And when you're broad, you're boring and
everybody just ignores you. And you sound like 99%
of the other businesses and marketers out there
saying the same things, like we offer higher quality and we offer better service
and all of that stuff that everybody's heard
a million times before and they're completely blind and deaf to. So the best way to solve this is to move on to our next point here, which is that you need an ICA. ICA is marketing talk for
ideal customer avatar. I'm not completely strict on this exact fictional representation of your ideal customer. And you've got to give them
a name and a hair color, and they've got to wear this kind of shoes and listen to this kind of music. I don't think that's necessary. It's helpful at times, what
I think is more important is that you get really clear
around the commonalities, the common characteristics
that your top customers, your top clients, your top
audience members have in common. And we typically divide this into three different categories. The first of which being demographic. So what's their age, their
gender, their income, their occupation, their title, all of those stereotypical
marketing things that we associate. Number two, what are
their geographic details? What city, state, province,
country, where do they live? Number three, they're
psychographic details. This is all of the head stuff. And this is where the bulk of your ICA should really be formed. So what are their values, their attitudes, their interests, their
beliefs, their organizations, their political affiliations,
their lifestyles, things that make them them. After all, we often want to group people into these broad buckets, like men or women or this age or that age. But the reality is
depending on what product or service you sell, you may
have a wide range of that. And it may be more problem based. On the other hand, you may also have multiple different ICAs, ideal customer avatars. That's cool too. I'm all right if you've got like, look, we work well with
women who are 20 to 25 and we also work well
with men who are 40 to 45, but those two different ICAs are gonna have different
pains and problems and fears and frustrations. We'll talk about that in just a second. So you can serve them both, but you need to serve them
both with different messages. You simply can't appeal to them by using the same generic,
broad, bland terminology 'cause you're just gonna
turn the other one off by talking about things that are completely irrelevant to them. So you have an ICA, but make sure that it's specific
and you can have multiple. And on that note, the
way to dive into that is with the psychographic details of their values and attitudes
and interests and beliefs. And I call that their
miracles and miseries. So let me find my pen, and
let's talk about that now. All right, so when it comes to creating your ideal customer avatar, when it comes to thinking
about your audience, your clients, your customers,
the money is, the value, the real results that you're going to get from your marketing come down to identifying their
miracles and miseries. Now there's this great
expression that I love that says customers don't
buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. The way to make them feel
understood is with this. So their miracles that's over here, that's all the things that
they want, their needs, their desires, their dreams, all of the things that
they wish would happen, the desired end state of
where they're trying to get. And then of course, over here,
you've got their miseries. These are their fears,
their problems, their pains, their frustrations, all of the things that they're
trying to get away from, at least in regards to your
business and to your offer. You need to identify what these are and ideally drill down into
which the most important and the most painful ones are. And then what the most
desirable end states are, because then you're going
to be able to position your business as the bridge that takes them from
miracle, oh, here we go. Memo to self: I gotta buy
some smaller tip markers, but that's it. This is your business right there. Your business's job, your offer,
your product, your service, whatever it is that you sell, it's only mission is to move them away from their current state
that they're in right now, that they don't want to be
in, whatever that pain is, and towards the desired end state. And the better that you're
able to communicate that, which is essentially the job of marketing, it's to communicate the value
of what you have to them in regards to your offer,
your product, your service. The better you're able to do that, the more likely you are to
get somebody to take action and to actually buy from
you and move them here. And this is where the conversions happen. It's right here. It's moving them away from
miseries and towards miracles. And on that note, let's
hit the next point here, which is a very cliched thing to say, but I wanna break it
down a little bit more. There's this super cliched
saying in marketing that says you want to sell
the benefits, not the features or sell the sizzle, not the steak. The problem is, is that like most cliches, there's that element of truth to it that's absolutely the fact here, is like when it comes to marketing and to representing what
it is that you're selling and what you're trying to promote, it's not about the features, it's about what those
features are going to deliver through the benefits. That's what they're after. They don't care about features. They care about how those features are going to positively impact them. So yes, we can make a cursory
mention of the features. We gotta highlight them. We'll talk about them. And we'll talk about kind
of the flip side of that in just a second, but the
real value is in the benefit. Now, one of my favorite examples and it kind of stems from
like, ""Hey, sell me this pen."" Well, it comes down to, this pen doesn't actually have a pen cap, but we're gonna use that analogy anyway. It's sort of like, well, why does the pen have a
pen cap or fictional pen cap? And the reason that this pen has a pen cap and the benefits it provides, that's what we wanna highlight. So the feature is a pen cap. The benefits is, well, it
prevents you from getting ink all over yourself. And then of course we
could elaborate on that. We could explain it a
little further and so on. A bit of a side note, do you know why pen caps have
like those tiny little holes? I dunno if you've got a pen
around, you can find one, but like they've got those
little holes on the pen lid, it's actually so if you swallow it, you don't choke to death. Random, hey. Anyway, the reason that benefits work significantly better than features, is because benefits
are emotionally driven, and emotion is far more
powerful driver than logic. It doesn't mean we can't have logic. It doesn't mean we shouldn't use logic. We absolutely should, but
emotion is the money maker. That's what compels
somebody to take action. When they feel it, like,
deep down in their core, this is going to make my life better. This is going to help me
achieve the goals that I want. This is going to increase my status. This is going to make me
healthier or happier or wealthier or any of those intrinsic
drivers that we have as humans, when we're able to
properly communicate that, that's when conversions happen. That's when sales happen. Now here's the kicker. When you're first creating your marketing, whether it's through an ad or a sales page or a social media post or an
email or anything like that, we always wanna highlight the benefits. And then of course, we're
gonna talk about the features. But if for some reason, people
don't convert, we flip it. And then the next time,
we lead with features and we back up the benefits. And the reason that we do this is because we know that emotion is a significantly more
powerful driver than logic, but logic still has a part. Not to mention, it's not
that some people are, or it's not just that some people are more emotional than logical. We all know those people that fall on one end of
the spectrum or another, but it's also that we, as people, we have days where we're more
emotional or more logical. And within those days, we have hours where we're more
emotional and more logical and there's situations and circumstances that you can't always control for, which is why we really
want to cover our bases. We wanna, of course, lead with emotion, 'cause it's the most powerful driver, but we want to back it up with logic. The next time somebody interacts with us, if we tried emotion and it didn't work, we'll lead with logic and
we'll back it up with emotion, and we'll kind of go back and forth. We'll sprinkle in social proof. We'll sprinkle in other
forms of testimonials, we'll sprinkle in guarantees
and risk reversals. We'll use all of the tools
in our toolbox as marketers to get somebody to take action, knowing full well that
we don't have control over where they're at right
now in their current situation. And it's funny, I didn't
actually plan this, but this actually kind
of leads us full circle back to that beginning statement of minimum effective dose of you're simply probably not doing enough if you're not getting the
results that you want. I mean, you can see here, when we look over the rule of seven and the mere exposure
effect, we need to go deep. We need to have ICAs, talk about their miracles and miseries. We need to highlight benefits. And if that doesn't work, we
go for the logical element. And then we go back to benefits. All of this is going to take time. It's gonna take energy, and it's gonna take
investment in your marketing, which is why if you're
at this stage right now where it's just not delivering
the results that you want, you need to do more. Now of course, I'm not
gonna leave you hanging with just that, which is why I'm gonna
link up a video right here that's gonna show you a
digital marketing strategy that's going to help. So make sure to check it out now, and we'll see you in the next video. Now the worst offense here is
not having a marketing funnel or more accurately not thinking
about your marketing funnel and instead, just hoping and wishing."
KI7rv8eIZbk,A REAL Social Media Strategy Example + Walkthrough in 2023,Unknown,27260,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KI7rv8eIZbk/hq720.jpg,2023-09-15 00:00:00,721,Milou Pietersz,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI7rv8eIZbk,every six figure social media manager is gatekeeping this information in today's video I am sharing exactly what's included in a high level social media strategy so that you can start getting your clients shocking results and stop charging pennies for your social media Services it's time to start making the big bucks hey my name is Mill and I own a multi-six figure social media agency and I now help social media managers do the same if you're new here make sure to grab my free roadmap to becoming a six-figure social media manager in the description below now let's dive in now before we start diving into this real example of a high level social media strategy that I create for all of our clients I want to emphasize that you have had the onboarding call with your client you have gathered all the information you need from them in order to now start creating their strategy okay so the very first thing you want to include in a high level social media strategy is the target audience now the reason why I mentioned that earlier is because it's not up to you to actually come up with who their target audience is right they should already have kind of an idea on who they're going after but now it's up to you as their social media strategist to actually research Their audience and figure out where they hang out get to know as much about them as possible what kind of audience are they create a customer Avatar that's what I like to do in my strategy so as you can see here I like to create a table format where I outline exactly what this audience is like right you want to be speaking directly to a person so that's the first thing I do now the second thing I do for that exact client customer Avatar is to create a description so this really helps my team myself as a creative to create a description on what kind of person are we going after right so in this case here you can see a little bit of a description about who we're targeting here and so that we have a clear picture in mind when we're creating content for social media who it's actually for right now as you saw in the very beginning I did have two customer avatars here listed for the target audience now it's very normal for clients and businesses to have at least two customer avatars two different types of clients that they're going after but I do recommend keeping it between one to three avatars and not going beyond that because it gets a very confusing and Broad when you do this whether it's one two or three that you list out here it might be that your client has multiple audiences that they're talking to with different messaging so to take myself for an example I obviously Target agency clients as well as social media managers for different offers so it's okay to have multiple avatars now the second thing that's included in a high level social media strategy is the objectives now what are the objectives you will have business objective business goals marketing goals as well as social media goals so again going back to that very first onboarding call you have with your clients and gathered all the information from them you need to know what their business goals are and marketing goals so that in the social media strategy you can show them what that means for the social media efforts and how you're going to track this so oftentimes for myself I always like to tell clients I will translate your wants into needs because you know a client will come to you they will say I want 10 000 followers what's the goal what's the purpose behind this so maybe they want to increase sales in their business they've been in business for maybe five years and now they want to utilize social media to make it happen that's completely possible Right but as you can see here in the strategy I have outlined what their business goals are how that looks into their social media goals and how I'm actually going to track that in their strategy over time right if you want to take it a step further you can even say these are 30 60 and 90 day goals and things you can expect coming from social media now if you want to know how I set expectations with new clients inside a social media proposal then make sure you check out my other video where I give you a step-by-step on how to create a social media proposal and it includes a free template now the third thing that's included in a high level social media strategy is a competitor analysis it's so important for you and your client to know what your competitors are up to and what they're doing well and what they're not doing well so that you guys have those insights and can apply this knowledge to your own profile now one of the tools I I love to utilize here is ninjalytics ninjalytics can show you insights into someone's Instagram profile and it's really great to just gather information on the outside from the competitor such as engagement rate number of times they post and things like that now some other tools that you can utilize to do a competitor analysis is to use semrush tools like semrush but Sumo they will all give you even more insights into competitors and how you compare to them as well again this is also important so you can show the client the growth over time and you can show how they compare against their competitors now this is not to say that it's always a fair comparison because it really depends on where they are at in their social media Journey before you start comparing them but it's good to know what other people in the industry are doing so here in the actual strategy you can see that I have gathered these insights from ninjalytics and also so I have gone into their social media itself so I can actually do some research and see what are they doing well what are they not doing well are they doing anything that we can probably apply later down the line and kind of taking notes for each one so that our client knows what other people are doing now the fourth thing that is included in a high level social media strategy is an audit now now it's time to conduct that research and Analysis that you applied to the competitors to your client itself so I like to start off with the same process as I did with the competitors just to check the insights on the client itself through ninjalytics and dive deep into their social media now an audit can include as much as you would like to audit but some of the things I include in the strategy are their profile insights and a Content audit and profile audit where I go into things that they can optimize right away so some things that I suggest they should change and Implement right away to have a quick win but also things like you know what type of captions are they writing or any links broken what are some things that they need to change ASAP right all those things will be in the audit because here's the thing oftentimes clients and business owners work with social media managers for years but till this day they have no clue what's going on with their social media what has been working and what hasn't been working so it's great for you to give a little bit of a summary to them and showcase hey this is what you've been doing well in the past couple of months and here's where we really need to make changes and adjust so that we can improve from here now if you want to know how you can offer social media audits as a standalone service then make sure you check out my other video how I show you how to make an extra 10K in your social media business by offering social media audits the fifth thing that is included in a high level social media strategy is the content strategy now we're going to start to get creative and the fun part is starting so some of the things I like to include in the content strategy in the strategy itself is their content pillars now after having done all the research into their competitors Their audience their own profile audit now it's up to you to align the content that you're going to create moving forward with their goals right what are they looking to achieve what kind of pillars do they need what kind of content goes hand in hand with achieving those goals so here you can see I like to break up the pillars by category whether it's educational content promotional shareable whatever the client needs in order to achieve what they're looking to achieve right again you want to include what type of content you're going to create for the client without having to yet map out the entire content calendar it's just to show them what kind of con content has been working well in the industry and that you want to apply to their profile as well because it resonates with their target audience now if you want to know exactly how I plan 30 days of content for myself and clients then make sure you watch this video where I share my exact workflow to do so the sixth thing that is included in a high level social media strategy is hashtags and keywords now almost all social media platforms make use of hashtags and keywords for visibility so for example Instagram we know hashtags are still a huge here whether it is to increase visibility or just to categorize your content so I do like to do my research here to see hey what hashtags would apply to us and would be great for us to use and maybe some of the competitors are using that we can apply as well now for example platforms like Tick Tock and Instagram whether it's hashtags or keywords these platforms are extremely searchable you can try it for yourself hop over to the search bar and you will see that you can search any keywords and the content that uses these keywords will pop up so whether it's hashtags or simple keywords you want to include this in this strategy and come up with keywords that your clients should be searched for okay so this again is extremely important to increase their visibility and for their social media SEO that has become more and more important on all platforms now these seventh and last thing you want to include in a high level social media strategy is the engagement effort your engagement strategy I like to break this up into two sections inbound and outbound engagements I go over this a lot but inbound is all the engagement coming in how are we going to respond how are we going to tackle this and an outbound engagement where we go out of our way this is a little bit more in depth where you can include welcome messages hashtags you want to Target types of profiles you want to comment on and even to the extent where you may want to include automated messages with Instagram's official partner manychat so that is another thing that you could include in this section but you want to come up with an engagement strategy because it's so important for growth customer service Community Management you name it you need an engagement strategy now if you need any inspiration on this then make sure you watch my other video where I shared a 1.80 engagement growth strategy that will set you up for Success if you don't have an engagement strategy in place right now now if you made it all the way till the end of this video then you now have all the information on what exactly is included in a high level social media strategy if you found this helpful make sure you like subscribe and share

XZZfDRphCmE,How to grow your brand on social media,Unknown,24800,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZZfDRphCmE/hq720.jpg?v=66498da1,2024-05-19 00:00:00,1284,orenmeetsworld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZZfDRphCmE,"all right today we're going to talk about making brand social media content in particular short form video that doesn't suck and that will actually perform for your brand we're going to talk about how you need to think about it we're going to talk about funnels for Content I'm going to give a bunch of examples of specific video types that basically anyone can make some of them require some production a lot of them are basic very simple and it's a blueprint you're going to be able to go through in this video at any point in time and find social media ideas you're going to be able to execute for your brand and so why do I have any credibility to be able to talk to you about this so first of all I'm pretty decent short form creator of my own right about half a million followers on platforms but I've also worked with a number of Brands I've worked with ones that have a million plus followers lots that have hundreds of thousands of followers I'll show some examples of specific content and things I've worked on inside this so I'm going to kick off with this video and I'm going to show a lot of videos you're going be able to watch while I do this this is a great example of content that shows a product but does it in an entertaining way every single clip you've seen so far has teased the product and then it finally shows it and shows it in a beautiful way and by the time it's actually shown it it gets back to the beginning where it teases again this to me underlies the Simplicity of what you need to do if you are have a brand and you're trying to show it and that is create things that people want to watch so plenty of Brands think that the algorithm has it out for them what they do can't succeed and it doesn't really come down to that unless we're in a prohibited category I'm not going to name the names of prohibited products because I'm not tring to get YouTube flagged but for the most part for Brands to sell any normal thing and they don't have some crazy political stance or trying to sell something really controversial you do not have a problem with the algorithm instead you are simply making things that consumers don't want to watch let's put this in a broader perspective you as a brand on a social media platform are competing with creators these are people whose lives are designed to be able to entertain they're making things that are humorous funny educational entertaining and these creators and the networks that they're on are competing with the larger world of entertainment they're competing with Netflix Disney Plus Peacock for consumers time when they are on their phones or lounging and in turn those are competing with traditional television sports ESPN network news this is all war for attention and so you as a brand need to be able to compete on the same scale as all of those people and so if you're out there just being like I'm going to make content and just about my products or my product Sal you to be the focal point of every single one of my videos you're going to fail unless you do it in a really intuitive way where you have some principles along the way but if you're content can't compete in any other way the algorithms don't owe you anything they are not going to just Propel it out there for no reason so what can you do two types of content all content the internet boils down to one of these two types you have a value content value content is what I make in all of my videos even if I'm selling something I explain to people something valuable to them that will help them as a person as a creative or in their business people will tune into to my content because you want to learn things and because I provide more value than your average person just telling stuff I try to go a level deeper and give actual tactics that are useful and that people don't often talk about that differentiates my content from another Creator Brands can offer value content as well one of my favorite examples of this is food companies that do a lot of recipe content recipe content is the ultimate value content because everyone wants to cook good food everyone loves to look at aesthetic food it's natural to our senses and we bookmark stuff like that all the time I don't particularly live in a food algorithm If Ever I see something where I'm like oh wow that is a amazing you know keto Fried Chicken I'm bookmarket it and Brands who are contributing to that or making their ingredients a focal P of that have a really easy way to naturally create value content basically think how can we in our role as a brand educate and I'll dive into some steps of that later then we have option b entertain there are a lot of ways for content to entertain there's obviously humor you can have series you can do cinematic things but even if you are going back to that video that I I've shown right before if you can just take your brand and show it in an entertaining way beautifully or aesthetically that's the beauty of Instagram reals right now on Tik Tok you can't just do things off aesthetic now you can't entertain by being funny you can't entertain by telling a good story by following Trends there's lots of ways to create entertainment cont content on Tik Tok that will help promote your brand but on Reals in particular you can just do it off the beauty and format of the content because that's a lot of the content that's rewarded there and so if you show your product in a beautiful away that is a form of entertainment those are the two buckets value or entertainment someone is consuming it just for fun and people consume a mix of both and Brands can create a mix of both there's a third type of content the third type of content is content that fails content that is doing neither of these things it's not particularly educating you or something you want to SA or you learn from or content that's entertaining you and making people feel good about themselves or want to share it or laugh or have a moment or be like wow that was cool and that is where the majority of Brands I have conversations with where like my social isn't going anywhere how do I improve my social they live there there's a certain tier of Brands who make pretty good content and they're trying to improve and take it to the next level you'll find some value in this too then you're getting down to the Nuance of I how do I make Exceptional videos video after video so for Brands having a toolkit I'm going to go back and forth between videos and and talking about how content works and inside this um there's all these different styles I'm going to talk about and the Beautiful unveil is a style and that's this first velour garments video that I showed off is a perfect example this is another one where if you have an interesting looking product or you can take it out in an interesting way all you simply have to do is unveil it and show off its details by basically be like I'm going to unpack this someone wants to see what the full extent of it is from what they're teased then they're going to see all the different bits in context and then repeat both of those videos are like what 8 seconds like this is not have to be like overthought and I think for anyone that has an interesting visual product this beautiful unveiling is a great concept um this last one I believe was likely shot on iPhone the one before that was shot on a DSLR but whatever your product is if it has a good-looking bag if it has a good- looking box even if it doesn't it's just okay go and carefully capture that in a similar format and this is one of the things I love to talk about for people that're like well how do I make content like this literally map this out shot for shot just write it down I'll do it with you like on this exact format that we have right here first shot someone's picking up a bag in a pile second shot they're unzipping the bag macro shot third shot pulling the product out of the bag still macro fourth showing a detail but not the whole product fifth showing another detail six they're actually smoothing out the full image of the product they're letting that one sit that's an outline of a video you literally go step by step like that and then write down the lengths of the shots and this is key cuz if you're first doing this you don't really know how social media content Works you're going to make those shots too long and so you literally could be like. 5 Seconds 8 seconds 1 second and you'll notice that besides that last shot and the first shot there's not much there it's going to be more than a second at best and now you have a format for creating this style of video and you go okay I'm going to take my same product I'm going to set up my cameras maybe a slightly different angle a little bit different look because you have something different and you're going to execute that same style and what's nice about having a lot of products having a brand is that you probably have a lot of different things that you can unveil that you can show you can try these formats on and if you haven't made multiple videos for all of them then you probably really haven't tried to see on social media right and you have an infinite cannon you can do by just doing this style of videos know what this style of videos is also amazing for is to go on your website on your product detail pages to show people the closeup of the product and you'll see this now on on my Shopify site so I just put these cashmir hats for sale and I have the standard kind of a lifestyle product photo of this up first but second I have literally a video like I would put on a real and this is just a quick one on an iPhone but I'm showing people in a short form format how they want to see it if I was going to do this in a real style I would literally just chop this into like half second blocks so it cut quicker between things but like you can just put this right under your PDP in your carel images and give people an experience where they get to actually see it which just means that the time and effort you put into this is worth than putting it on your product detail page putting that content into your emails Etc get the most value out of the content you create all right so I'm going to bring up a second type of content this is a key walkthrough video so this is a video where you are going to go through your product and discuss why something about it is special so literally you'll see is a lot of these shots they're all about 2 seconds seconds long where he's walking through the details of this particular fit and it's not about the outfit it's about the product itself it's not a complicated video it's all on iPhone just captioned above and this is like a standard capcut caption style and he's literally just walking through what makes it special and stands out and if you have a product that does have things special then talk about that and obviously he's a beautiful viral looking product now if you are making products you don't look like that and you have the ability to so I'm to start thinking about how do I make things that stand out in social media but that's probably a whole separate video I actually think that's going to be the next video I do is like building luxury products um we'll talk a bit about this but even if you have a basic product you can still have that conversation and I show a lot of clothing just because I get out clothing content served in my feed this is applicable to anything so this is olive oil and they're literally talking about why do we choose to use a can for our refills and they're having a little bit of fun with it obviously like old boy is in his science costume in front of his whiteboard and uh they're having some fun with the captions and like that's a good thing to do have a little personality with your brand if it fits your brand or be a little more serious and buttoned up if you had a more serious brand and someone's there like in a suit in a nice setting that could equally resonate in the same way but he's literally explaining a key thing around their brand into this content and this format of like a key explainer and you can be shot on iPhone candidly you can be shot you nice in a different way is a great thing to do where you think of what is a some a story I can tell in like 20 or 30 seconds about a key thing of my product where you're providing a combination of value and kind of your product sales and are these always going to Skyrocket no but are they a useful content format to have yes now we have doing this content in action so this is actually a project I worked on where we're doing all the tutorials about gel blasters and basically how to use them and it was like okay well do we want to do just a standard content about like how you use something like this or is it better if you're actually in a gel Blaster battle at the same time that someone's giving a tip it is obviously significantly more exciting if you're giving the tip while you're inside the battle and if the audio is on it's not here going to be telling her she's literally telling you like how to hydrate and refill uh your gel so you use like inside inside this like while you're doing the video in action and this has 60,000 views whereas a video of us just explaining this is how it works would have like 3,000 views this is another one I worked on when I was doing social lift foils uh and this is actually one like I will give the videographer full credit like on this I had the concept that we need to be doing more of these educational videos about how to do things like wake foiling because people just don't know and understand and then they actually like miked up Brian here and like executed this like while he's actually on the board which just adds this like captivation element to the content that's huge right because you're basically seeing two things at once he's explaining what he's doing while he's doing it you're like immediately asking questions like oh he's like miked up on that is he going to fall in the water and you get to see it in action happening and this was like a one .8 million view video and then immediately there are more of these and they also hit like equally as well and so obviously these are like more like outdoors and products that have a natural exciting element to them but you could easily have just made this same content and had it not be this exciting and had it not go anywhere and so if you have that ability to have excitement and especially if you are athletic wear workout gear or supplements or whatever it is like give people some action inside of it and then even if you're not like what else could you be doing from a lifestyle perspective to explain those tips like you uh and this goes two ways too like you can explain how your products used inside that context you can also be like explaining other things or giving tips in other environments and something I like to think about for this is like if I had an auto themed clothing brand and like if I'm giving tips about like how I can fix a carburetor while I'm in the gear or whatever like there's another degree of connection that can happen there but this content is really exciting to me the idea of like give a tip about your product or teach people how to use it but add that second element of doing it like in some kind of non-standard circumstance ideally like while it's in action but like even if someone's walking or running or in I think a great thing that um my friend Alex Garcia did at the collective is they were doing these and they had them inside the cold punch like while they were doing it just add that second dimension to it it's a kind of thing that is pretty easy to execute from a production standpoint but it is significantly more exciting when it's actually seen in the algorithm and becomes significantly more sharable and now who shown some content this is a good opportunity to step back and talk about content funnels um I think I had a video where I interviewed about this on a podcast go viral on on Instagram and um it's one of those videos where like I didn't accept the collaboration request and I was like ah you know it's not really kind of a fit and of course it goes viral uh but uh so content funnels if you're familiar with the concept of funnel funnel goes down I like a lot of people will know sales funnels and marketing funnels you're trying to get a customer from the top of the funnel down to the bottom of the funnel where they're close the top of funnel for content is something I love to talk about because a lot of Brands don't understand and can't separate I need to sell this product I need to be selling my service or I need to sell what I do as a Creator every video and the way the algorithms work especially Instagram Tik tok's a little different YouTube's a little different but like if someone likes your content on Instagram or they follow you on Instagram you're immediately shown like four or five of that person's videos the next few times that you log in and scroll they will automatically give you more content it's great for the Creator it's also great for the brand but what this is is gives you a crucial step you need to think about in The Funnel which is like how do I make content that gets millions of views whether or not it achieves my objectives or gets me followers or gets me sales if I can get content that my Target demographic or people that will my product C then I'm immediately going to get my other popular videos fed to them and they're going to see probably the next thing that I post and if I think of this like a funnel I go great what is the things that I can attract the most attention with and then when we talk about middle of funnel it goes okay then how can I educate them about actually making a purchase and if you think about content like this it becomes really important so top of funnel videos that just get attention don't add sales may not even need to have your product I'll show you examples the do middle of funnel these are just videos your standard videos that either Drive value like we talked about or entertain but like are more based around your brand your product and your story and the things you're trying to promotee but they're done in ways that are natural to succeed on social media but they have that element to them where people are going to look at that and they I want to buy that or I want to support that person or whatever it is and then the bottom of the funnel the bottom of the funnel is that of stuff you have to make where you're like okay the drop is today we need to make a video about it like all right hey we got to go make some we going was some [Â __Â ] sales dro the video about it and that's something where like that's the least of the ratio of content of what you should be making but you still need to consider it inside where what you're creating and so if you balance this out and you go I want to have one or two every week top of funnel videos and maybe they don't always hit but I'm trying and I want to have two or three this middle of funnel was my core content sometimes they get big sometimes they do all right we're knocking them out there and I want one where I'm just going I'm going for it I got to go get the job done that's a great mix of content for a Creator or for a brand and your strategy will be more sophisticated and 99% of brands that are out there so what are examples of top of funnel content this first one's a bit of a mix it's giving the educational elements of value content but it's meant to go viral and this is the idea that you can take a tip or take something like a creation and then just make it like excessive so this is recipe content he's making an old fashioned he's just making a massive oldfashioned so basically you take a core video or like a tip video and you add a viral element to it which is literally just like size is a great one can you do an extra large version this works all the time on social media so if you do have content where it's like I'm going to show you how to make a protein shake or I'm because I have a supplement that goes inside of it or I'm going to show you how to do extra y like doing the crazy version of that like adding scale this is something I talk about in if you haven't gotten my like creative Ops like free report thing I did I have a whole like creative Direction this is one of the strategies it's like how do you make it extreme or how do you pull something back to like just its Essence to take an idea or a reference and make it more interesting and this is just a perfect example where if you have some successful content as you know for a brand already make it super sized and then there's using viral elements and like these little mini waffle makers like always have a bunch of viral elements I I have a lot of food content chused on here another great example of stuff that was like a natural viral element was when all the creators were using those little treadmills and like walking on the treadmills or talking or running on the treadmills like you can kind of see what's happening in the world around you and create something to that but not all going to be food here this is one of my favorites and one of my favorite strategies this is these tiny aesthetic reels this is like a 6 or 8C reel from 2js who are smashing on social media and literally it's one visual concept our jewelry on a turntable they have like eight or 10 shots they let it kind of you go in an interesting way and it's something where you're going to watch you're going to stop scrolling on reals you're going to watch it for a couple seconds be like oh what's happening here oh can I see that piece again and then the video is already played like three times it's a genius top of final content strategy it's based on just a visual mechanism their product on a turn table and you can think about what could I put my product on or what could it do that would be interesting another great example of the same thing they just literally flipped a video of their Ceramics on strings so it looks the opposite way which is just super scroll stopping and just an excellent top of funel piece and so especially if you have a creative team or your creative like really be diving into like what are those little unique things that we can try that will just stop people on the page and those few that you know that I've just shown are like great Styles and looks that you can kind of build your own references and then if you have like if you're from a bigger brand or you have a real creative team or you have a particular skill set on that like go Artful right um so this is I mean this is big budget this is on and post archive faction from from Korea but like this looks like unlike anything that is on reals today and if you have the ability to do that and to get people to go holy [Â __Â ] I need to stop and watch this then that is like the best of of all worlds especially for us as creatives creative directors art directors like this is the goal right you may not always have the production budgets or anything like that but like if you do have the resources in the team like this is what what to try to make and I like to look at this from uh like Martin Rose has this as a Trope where they have this kind of like rotating thing that's on there and this content is a little you know a little niche U but again kind of has that same like okay if we took an Artful approach to top of funnel content so now let's hit some middle of funnel tactical content I love this concept of the Showcase so the Showcase is when you put a setting together and then you rapid fire show off whether it's your work as a creative or an agency or your Rebrand or your line and so in this video they set up the stage of they go like hey we have this brand uh we have a mood board what we're going to create and then here's what we built out of it so it sets that up in the few seconds and then it just gives you still images in a row and again that video is like what 6 8 seconds long like what stories do you have from your brand assets to be able to put things like this together extremely similar format for behind the scenes like you're doing a Photoshop Etc where like they just shot again that's three leadup shots and then just the photos and then this is already going to be done and that these are the little vetts that can come dayto day that are really easy to show and great content that has a potential to go viral and no matter what is brand focused and educational a great version for a clothing brand literally the first shot is he just pulls this rack out makes you wait and then just shows the different pieces in the collection snapping back and forth like and then then it repeats this is not complicated but a lot of just social media teams just kind of overthink what they have to do when like you have formats like this like for any collection you have any setup of different things any photo shoot that you do any new Rebrand assets or campaign assets this type of video should be on the list every single time you do one of them now if you have a great storytelling team you have good copywriting you people with the ability to write good content um these are great formats as well you literally write out a story and you're just using lots and lots of shots to kind of quickly tell that story two words on screen Max like using your b-roll to move along with this takes more editing work these move super fast but again you copyrighting is part of the strength of the org that you have write these and take examples like this and like literally it be like all right how would I in the same word count same time count tell a story about my brand whether it's our origin story why I made this product why we're based in wherever we're based why we hired this person who's on our team what our vision for the future is like where our warehouse team uses to do their work whatever another person who's done a great job with this is Spencer he was in uh like the first cut 30 cohort like we ever did and just is an amazing Storyteller he was only on on Twitter I think before that but just understood how to write again knows how to put these shots together like has mapped all this out into a storyline and there's a lot of people that have that skill set and especially if a videography background but this is all act thought it's just lots of zooms and lots of texts on the screen to read and like dominates on Tik Tok and he runs it as an ad as well and it's just really sick if you haven't seen his product Tails it's like this uh it's like a a game you can play with other members of your family to uh learn more about their history which is super sick he's crushing it and like a really fun time so recommended to check out and so there's like hundreds of more content examples I could go through of things to do but this is a pretty good setup to get you started and thinking about content that you can do for your brand that is and almost all the things I applied apply to creative work as well if you're showing off your portfolio it's a lot of the same principles like those showcase videos I just saw or like even in unveiling uh like if you actually made something or a prototype like taking it out or covering the screen or showing the mood board first and then transitioning it into like the little pieces of the of your of your your piece like into the whole thing uh there's a lot of those same principles that can really apply overall no matter who you are think about that Chain by making value or am I making entertainment or am I failing and then am I making content for the top of funnel am I making it for the medium middle or am I making it for the bottom and I'm about to start making content for my brand I've made a few videos like test videos already just seeing what they can do on the algorithm I'm about to start doing a lot more and I'll share a bit about how those are working as well and so so you see here I've got th followers here some of the things that they have kind of worked here is like I've done these little compilation videos kind of a little more motivational but again just super quick shots something that you know people can like like like and share same thing with this kind of idea of that opening hook shot and I'm just showing a bunch of my products like shot after shot with some lifestyle kind of cut in between these are just simple like set the stage videos that I'm using to explore the algorithm a bit before I dive in deeper but I'm going to start sharing the things that are working the things that are not and the ideas I have in some of these future videos but anyway if you want to dive deeper into content with me we do our cut 30 thing uh once every month it's like a 30-day boot camp I'm trying not to sell a bunch of stuff inside these YouTubes but uh we do that every 30 days people do ask about it a bunch and um I think our next one is Tuesday May 21st coming up so if you're interested in that it's cut 3.co and then I did put out this creative Ops guide for free that you can find on the hypers site I'll link it down in here too um you have to go on Air's landing page and you sign up and then it will they'll email to you uh but this has like a bunch of creative Direction strategies for how to look at content how to think about content as a team and how to like analyze Trends to make good content so if you're part of a bigger team at like a org uh and you're like building brand content there's a ton of strategies I have inside that and anyway that is content drop more questions at the bottom I know I didn't cover a lot of like starting from scratch hoping to do that pretty well and like what I do documenting my brand Journey um and know a lot for more like existing Brands and social teams so we'll conquer that in a new video but uh appreciate you watching and let's go"

XDWJXec-B_s,Branding 101: How To Build A Strategic Brand in 2024,Unknown,333398,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XDWJXec-B_s/hq720.jpg,2023-07-19 00:00:00,1504,Brand Master Academy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDWJXec-B_s,"What's up brand builders Stephen HouraghanÂ 
here at BrandMasterAcademy.com and in thisÂ Â  video you're going to learn branding 101 how toÂ 
build a strategic brand so you can understand theÂ Â  machine that influences audiences to choose yourÂ 
business of your competitors again and again soÂ Â  what exactly is branding well look it's a prettyÂ 
broad question and when you sit down and thinkÂ Â  of it there are many different perspectives onÂ 
this a lot of different players with differentÂ Â  opinions and different positions on what brandingÂ 
actually is but when you strip away all of thatÂ Â  complication and really think about what brandingÂ 
is it's about making a business more appealingÂ Â  to a certain group of people than the competitorsÂ 
and the aim of the game here is to influence theirÂ Â  buying decision now a lot of people believe thatÂ 
branding is about how a brand looks you know theÂ Â  the logo how it appears visually and for the mostÂ 
part the they are right to some extent but reallyÂ Â  that's only the tip of the iceberg beyond theÂ 
iceberg below the surface you have a machine ofÂ Â  elements all working together to make up the brandÂ 
if all you have is a logo if all you have areÂ Â  the visuals then there's no mechanism behind thatÂ 
brand to make those connections with the audienceÂ Â  so to answer the question what is branding it'sÂ 
all about understanding exactly who that audienceÂ Â  is and then building a brand and an ecosystemÂ 
around that to make that business more appealingÂ Â  to that group of people so why exactly is brandingÂ 
so important well think about the alternative forÂ Â  a second you have a business and you want peopleÂ 
to buy your stuff but in order for them to buyÂ Â  your stuff you're going to have to influenceÂ 
them now if all you know about branding is thatÂ Â  you need a logo on a website and you go aheadÂ 
and pay a designer to get that logo and to getÂ Â  that website and you put that website out into theÂ 
world what do you have to influence those peopleÂ Â  the Assumption there is that people are justÂ 
going to come to your website and see that youÂ Â  have a good looking brand you have a website copyÂ 
telling them what you do and then they're justÂ Â  going to hit that buy button but the reality isÂ 
completely different there are so many businessesÂ Â  vying for the attention of your audience andÂ 
they're doing their very best to influence theirÂ Â  buying decision and they're not just using logosÂ 
and websites they're digging deep to understandÂ Â  exactly who Their audience is how they tick youÂ 
know what makes them tick what drives them whatÂ Â  motivates them what what what are their fearsÂ 
what is it that they really want to achieve andÂ Â  what problems do they have that the business canÂ 
solve once they understand all of that then theyÂ Â  can devise a plan of how they will communicate toÂ 
them that will influence how they feel and thinkÂ Â  about that brand which will ultimately influenceÂ 
their decision okay so what is the differenceÂ Â  between brand strategy and brand identity theseÂ 
are two terms that are often used synonymously orÂ Â  if people see these terms side by side they can'tÂ 
really differentiate between the two the brandÂ Â  identity is the visual brand it's how the brandÂ 
shows up in the world visually so we're talkingÂ Â  here about those visual assets we're talking aboutÂ 
the logo the color palette the fonts the imageÂ Â  style you know everything that the brand usesÂ 
to show up visually is the brand identity that'sÂ Â  how the brand is represented visually the brandÂ 
strategy on the other hand is the plan behind theÂ Â  brand and how they're going to engage and resonateÂ 
and connect with that audience again to ultimatelyÂ Â  influence their decision now the brand identityÂ 
will have an influence on the audience they willÂ Â  see that identity and if the colors and the styleÂ 
match what they like it will draw them in but itÂ Â  won't influence their buying decision just withÂ 
the visuals behind those visuals there has to beÂ Â  some kind of strategy and some kind of messagingÂ 
that's going to speak to who they are that's whereÂ Â  the brand strategy comes in within the brandÂ 
strategy you understand who that audience isÂ Â  you understand what the competitors are offeringÂ 
them and then you have a position in the marketÂ Â  that's different from those competitors andÂ 
that difference is going to offer your audienceÂ Â  an alternative to what's already out there inÂ 
the market and with that difference with thatÂ Â  understanding of what you do and the value you'reÂ 
going to bring to the table it's going to helpÂ Â  them to make their decision with that positionÂ 
you need to communicate that position well andÂ Â  you do that through your messaging strategy youÂ 
do that through your your storytelling and youÂ Â  also do that through your brand personalityÂ 
they are the characteristics that you use theÂ Â  traits that you use the verbal identity how you'reÂ 
going to speak to your audience are you going toÂ Â  be cheeky are you going to be fun are you goingÂ 
to be formal or authoritative what is it that'sÂ Â  going to draw them in to help them to choose youÂ 
over your competitors all of these elements comeÂ Â  together in the brand strategy and that is theÂ 
makeup of the strategy and on the front lines ofÂ Â  that is the visual identity so they work hand inÂ 
hand together to ultimately influence the audienceÂ Â  the perception they have of the brand and theirÂ 
buying decision now behind every successful brandÂ Â  are a set of familiar fundamental pillars thatÂ 
provides the foundation for that brand to growÂ Â  so let's dive into each one of these pillars firstÂ 
up is the brand DNA now within the brand DNA youÂ Â  have a few key ingredients here you've got yourÂ 
purpose your vision your mission and your valuesÂ Â  now this is probably the most common common areaÂ 
of branding the people are aware of before theyÂ Â  get into positioning and differentiation andÂ 
personality they will probably come acrossÂ Â  these elements first and foremost and they tendÂ 
to be overlooked a little bit in terms of theirÂ Â  importance people put together a purpose statementÂ 
a vision statement a mission statement some valuesÂ Â  and then they don't know how to communicate themÂ 
but communicating them is not the name of the gameÂ Â  the brand DNA is about who the brand is internallyÂ 
and it's there to guide decisions and actions asÂ Â  to where that brand is going where they're goingÂ 
in the future what are they committed to in orderÂ Â  to achieve their vision for the future whatÂ 
do they hold dear in the way they do businessÂ Â  through their values these are all internal guideÂ 
posts to help the brand make the right decisionsÂ Â  so that the brand stays on track it stays on brandÂ 
in terms of where the leaders want that brand toÂ Â  go and what perception they want to create inÂ 
the market so it's really important to have theÂ Â  Brandy and a first and foremost the leadershipÂ 
team and everybody within the brand knows whereÂ Â  they're going next up is the target audience nowÂ 
I have seen this mistake time and again BusinessÂ Â  Leaders they come to the table with a businessÂ 
plan and they have an idea for a product or aÂ Â  service but they really haven't taken the timeÂ 
to consider exactly who they're trying to helpÂ Â  they know there's a market out there for theirÂ 
products and their services but every Market isÂ Â  broken up into segments and if you turn up with aÂ 
product or service to the market that is meant forÂ Â  the entire Market most likely you're going to missÂ 
out on pretty much all of those segments becauseÂ Â  you're not relevant enough to those segments soÂ 
think of your Market as a pie now if you turn upÂ Â  to the market and you try to appeal to that wholeÂ 
pie then chances are you're not going to be ableÂ Â  to do that if on the other hand you segment or youÂ 
slice up that pie and you hone in on a particularÂ Â  slice then you can identify what differencesÂ 
those people have within that segment to theÂ Â  rest of the market and when you understand thatÂ 
when you understand those differences when youÂ Â  understand what makes them tick then you canÂ 
appeal to them more specifically so this isÂ Â  without a doubt one of the most important aspectsÂ 
in the whole spectrum of branding and marketing isÂ Â  getting clear on exactly what segment of theÂ 
market you want to Target so you can appealÂ Â  to them more specifically and be more relevant toÂ 
who they are next up is your positioning strategyÂ Â  now again going back to the leader going intoÂ 
the market for the first time having a productÂ Â  and a service that the market wants is great butÂ 
if your product and service is the exact same asÂ Â  everybody else in the market first of all you'reÂ 
at a disadvantage because those are the playersÂ Â  in the market already have that awareness theyÂ 
already have a head start on you so you're notÂ Â  giving your audience anything to really choose youÂ 
over them so you're at a complete disadvantage ifÂ Â  you just have the same as everybody else so whatÂ 
you need to do is you need to understand whatÂ Â  your competitors are offering your audience andÂ 
then look for gaps and opportunities as to whatÂ Â  the audience wants and what they're not gettingÂ 
from your competitors in the market and that'sÂ Â  where your opportunity for your positioningÂ 
strategy lies and your differentiation inÂ Â  the market so this is really about showing up toÂ 
the market with something different to offer anÂ Â  alternative to what's already out there and lookÂ 
this doesn't necessarily need to be disruptiveÂ Â  you don't need to be an Uber going into the marketÂ 
disrupting the the taxi industry it just needs toÂ Â  be something slightly different maybe it's theÂ 
way you provide your services maybe it's doneÂ Â  with you instead of done for you maybe there'sÂ 
a an element of convenience to it maybe there'sÂ Â  something along the brand experience that's aÂ 
little bit different to what your competitorsÂ Â  are offering but this is really really importantÂ 
to show up to the market not just with the sameÂ Â  as everybody else not the same price products inÂ 
the same Services targeting the same people TargetÂ Â  someone different Target a specific segment of theÂ 
market and give them within the market somethingÂ Â  different than your competitors are offering andÂ 
they will turn their attention towards you theÂ Â  next pillar is your brand personality now showingÂ 
up to the market with a great visual brand is aÂ Â  really good way to get some attention to getÂ 
some visual attention but let's say for exampleÂ Â  you have a beautiful looking website you haveÂ 
a beautiful logo and then your audience turnsÂ Â  up to your side and your website copy is BlandÂ 
and it's dry and there's there's nothing reallyÂ Â  there to draw your audience in you're speaking inÂ 
corporate tones it's very very easy to lose theÂ Â  attention of modern consumers today because quiteÂ 
frankly you know this yourself we don't have a lotÂ Â  of attention to give other people or other brandsÂ 
and we really need to feel drawn in to give ourÂ Â  attention and brand personality is a great wayÂ 
to do that and this goes back to understandingÂ Â  who your audience is not just what they want notÂ 
just their desires and their fears but also whatÂ Â  is their personality what traits do they haveÂ 
what is it that they're trying to achieve inÂ Â  life are they you know chilled out do they have aÂ 
connection with the Earth are they driven are theyÂ Â  full of energy do they want to save the world areÂ 
they authoritative do they have a desire to haveÂ Â  a high status in society what is it that drivesÂ 
them and what are their personal quality traitsÂ Â  when you really understand that you can understandÂ 
how to show up with your brand and archetypes areÂ Â  a very very good foundation for you to build yourÂ 
brand personality with if you don't know whatÂ Â  archetypes are I have a video on brand archetypesÂ 
I'll leave that in the description but it's aboutÂ Â  understanding the personality of your audienceÂ 
and then really putting together a personalityÂ Â  that's going to appeal to who they are and usingÂ 
traits within how you communicate and not justÂ Â  your visuals here but your messaging as well whatÂ 
tone of voice are you going to use what traits areÂ Â  you going to use within your communication withinÂ 
your writing and that will really help to draw inÂ Â  your audience because you're showing up to theÂ 
market with a bit of personality and somethingÂ Â  different to what's already out there the nextÂ 
pillar is your verbal identity now I touchedÂ Â  on this with the brand personality and verbalÂ 
identity is essentially an extension of yourÂ Â  brand personality it's the way your brand speaksÂ 
in the market how it it talks the language thatÂ Â  it used the the the tone of voice it's going toÂ 
use so you know are you going to show up with youÂ Â  know rough language rugged language are you goingÂ 
to be a little bit edgy or are you going to showÂ Â  up a little bit more relaxed more eco-friendlyÂ 
a little bit more soft in how you communicateÂ Â  with your audience so there's a lot of scope forÂ 
differentiation here just within your your verbalÂ Â  identity alone so really thinking about you knowÂ 
how we are as people how we connect with otherÂ Â  people and the people that you like within yourÂ 
lives you know do you tend to have a group ofÂ Â  friends that are energetic and a little bit moreÂ 
edgy and you know use bad language or do you tendÂ Â  to gravitate more towards people who are kind ofÂ 
laid back and you know speaking soft tones so justÂ Â  understanding this alone about yourself and yourÂ 
own life and the the people that you're attractedÂ Â  to will help you to understand how brands useÂ 
verbal identity and again this this goes back toÂ Â  who your audience is who you're trying to connectÂ 
with who you're trying to appeal to but as I saidÂ Â  there's a lot of scope for differentiationÂ 
within your verbal identity but it's reallyÂ Â  understanding the role that you're going toÂ 
play in the market who your audience is andÂ Â  the way you're going to resonate with them nextÂ 
up is your brand messaging now this is probablyÂ Â  the one of the most impactful tools of influenceÂ 
that any brand has and it probably overlooked moreÂ Â  than not by brand leaders who go into the marketÂ 
trying to build a brand they put all this focus onÂ Â  how the brand looks you know the logo the websiteÂ 
how they're appearing in the market and they putÂ Â  very little emphasis on the messaging that they'reÂ 
going to put out there in the market now I'm notÂ Â  just talking about copywriting here copywritingÂ 
on your website this is the whole spectrum ofÂ Â  communication within your brand you know you needÂ 
to Define exactly what you want to say to yourÂ Â  audience what's important to your audience whenÂ 
it comes to choosing a brand when it comes to overÂ Â  coming the problem that they have what is it thatÂ 
they're they're looking for and what signals willÂ Â  provide them with the idea that you have what theyÂ 
need so your brand messaging is super important inÂ Â  determining exactly what you want to say to yourÂ 
audience and how you're going to distribute thoseÂ Â  messages across channels now again this goesÂ 
hand in hand with your brand personality theÂ Â  messages that you put out there into the marketÂ 
is what you're going to say and the personalityÂ Â  and the verbal identity is how you're going toÂ 
say them so understanding what you want to sayÂ Â  is super critical in influencing how your audienceÂ 
perceives your brand the next pillar is your storyÂ Â  now your Brand Story can come in different formsÂ 
of course you have the Founder's story so who theÂ Â  founder is where they've come from where they'reÂ 
going to now in all honesty your audience is notÂ Â  too interested in who the founder is now that willÂ 
probably crush a few egos here but really buildingÂ Â  a brand is not about you it's all all aboutÂ 
your audience the story that your brand needsÂ Â  to be telling or certainly needs to be focusingÂ 
on is the story of your audience now you can doÂ Â  this in many different ways you can look at pastÂ 
clients or past customers that have been throughÂ Â  the process that you provide and documentÂ 
that document that through case studies andÂ Â  testimonials so that they can tell their storyÂ 
that will resonate with your future audienceÂ Â  or with your future customers but this is reallyÂ 
about resonating and connecting we're all drawnÂ Â  in to stories we certainly remember stories a lotÂ 
more than we remember facts and if you're able toÂ Â  make that emotional connection and if you're ableÂ 
to tell a story that kind of aligns with who yourÂ Â  audience is the journey that they're on whereÂ 
they're coming from where they're going to theÂ Â  challenges that they're having along the wayÂ 
they're the kinds of stories that draw Us inÂ Â  and if you think about this yourself when you sitÂ 
down to read a story and there are many differentÂ Â  characters within the story you tend to take theÂ 
a position of the protagonist within the storyÂ Â  and you tend to follow their journey and that'sÂ 
exactly what we want to do with our audience weÂ Â  want to tell that story and if your story isÂ 
super aligned with the journey that they'reÂ Â  on they're going to be drawn in so thinking aboutÂ 
exactly what you do as a brand where you've comeÂ Â  from where you're going is is great but when youÂ 
really nail down your audience and their story andÂ Â  you weave that in to the stories that you tellÂ 
and the messages that you put out there in theÂ Â  market then you're really going to draw yourÂ 
audience in because you will confirm to yourÂ Â  audience that you understand their Journey whatÂ 
they're going through where they're going andÂ Â  what they're trying to achieve and then of courseÂ 
you have your brand name and your tagline now thisÂ Â  might seem strange that it's so far along and weÂ 
haven't mentioned this before but really if youÂ Â  think about it your brand name and your taglineÂ 
is a strategic tool it tells your audience whoÂ Â  you are and what you're about and if you do thisÂ 
early on in the process then you're not going toÂ Â  have the added advantage of knowing the positionÂ 
that you want to take in the market the differenceÂ Â  you're going to offer the personality that you'reÂ 
going to show up with and the messages that you'reÂ Â  putting out there into the market when you haveÂ 
that information putting together a brand nameÂ Â  and a tagline is far more effective because it'sÂ 
helping you solidify that position it's helpingÂ Â  you to communicate to your audience exactly howÂ 
you're going to help them and what you're allÂ Â  about so this is a really really important partÂ 
of branding and you know it tends to be kind ofÂ Â  tacked on to services that are out there but in myÂ 
opinion this is probably one of the most importantÂ Â  aspects in the whole spectrum of branding becauseÂ 
when people see your brand name and they see yourÂ Â  tagline you know you think about how many peopleÂ 
will see that and if you're able to throw a hookÂ Â  out with that brand name and that tagline and itÂ 
resonates with them quickly it tells them quicklyÂ Â  what you're about and what you can potentially doÂ 
for them that will help them to bring them intoÂ Â  your world so really Define finding a brand nameÂ 
that is aligned with your position in the marketÂ Â  and the position that you're trying to own andÂ 
the message that you're trying to get across toÂ Â  your audience is really important if you do thisÂ 
too early in the process you're going to miss thatÂ Â  opportunity and unfortunately that's how mostÂ 
brand names are created they're created by theÂ Â  business owner before considering the strategy butÂ 
the right way to do it is to consider the strategyÂ Â  then develop the brand name And the tagline andÂ 
last but not least you have your visual identityÂ Â  now we're getting to the visual identity at PointÂ 
number nine when a lot of people believe when theyÂ Â  think about a brand or building a brand this isÂ 
the first point that they will look towards toÂ Â  build their brand but really think about all theÂ 
elements that we have considered up until thisÂ Â  point we've considered who the audience is we'veÂ 
considered the competitors in the market how we'reÂ Â  positioned in the market the difference we'reÂ 
going to make the personality that we want toÂ Â  show up with what those traits are and the verbalÂ 
identity within that personality as well and theÂ Â  messages and stories that we want to send out intoÂ 
the market now think about all the tools we haveÂ Â  at our disposal to design the visual identityÂ 
and think about the designer in this positionÂ Â  being able to reflect on the strategy and allowingÂ 
that to guide their designs compared to a designerÂ Â  who is sitting down with an open brief to designÂ 
a visual identity for you know brand name X soÂ Â  designing the visual identity with the strategyÂ 
in mind is the best way to do this because weÂ Â  can really consider that personality and thoseÂ 
traits and weave that in to the person into theÂ Â  visualized identity that we are designing so againÂ 
a really really crucial element in the brand whenÂ Â  we see the brand for the first time it has thatÂ 
immediate impact on us and there is no elementÂ Â  within the brand that is as impactful as thatÂ 
visual identity in that short space of time thatÂ Â  we have to really draw our audience in so it'sÂ 
really really important but it's really broughtÂ Â  into the context of how important it is is reallyÂ 
under the microscope when we consider the strategyÂ Â  beforehand and we consider how that strategy canÂ 
influence the design so now that we know all theÂ Â  pillars what is the process in putting all thisÂ 
together in building the brand and building thoseÂ Â  pillars and then getting that out there into theÂ 
market well simply following those pillars thatÂ Â  I've put forward which are in chronological orderÂ 
should be developed in that chronological orderÂ Â  the purpose the vision the mission the valuesÂ 
understanding what's important to the businessÂ Â  leader where the brand is going and what they areÂ 
committed to in the way they do business and thenÂ Â  looking into the market to who the audience isÂ 
and what really they're trying to achieve andÂ Â  what segment of the market you're going to TargetÂ 
because remember you can't Target the whole MarketÂ Â  or you're simply going to blend in you're notÂ 
going to really appeal to those because you don'tÂ Â  have enough specificity targeting a segmentÂ 
within the market gives you that opportunityÂ Â  to to add specificity and then when you know thatÂ 
Target you want to go after you can look at who'sÂ Â  already serving that audience and what they're notÂ 
doing well what gaps they're leaving in the marketÂ Â  that's where you find your positioning strategyÂ 
that's where you find your difference and that'sÂ Â  where you're going to be able to add value to theÂ 
market once you've done that once you've definedÂ Â  your position then it's all about how are we goingÂ 
to show up in the market what's the personalityÂ Â  we're going to lead with what are those traitsÂ 
and what are those verbal identity elements thatÂ Â  we'll use what are the traits that we're goingÂ 
to use when we speak to our audience then we moveÂ Â  into the messaging and the storytelling so we'reÂ 
understanding what we want to say to our audienceÂ Â  so that when we go out into the market andÂ 
communicate with our audience we're influencingÂ Â  their perception about what we mean in a strategicÂ 
way instead of just blurting out anything thatÂ Â  we think they want to hear we have methodicallyÂ 
sat down and understood what perception we wantÂ Â  to have in the market and what messages we needÂ 
to put into the market in order to achieve thatÂ Â  percent exception then we go into the visualÂ 
Identity Design we get our designer on boardÂ Â  and we put that visual identity at there into theÂ 
market now that is just building the brand that isÂ Â  building the vehicle that is our brand that we'reÂ 
going to be able to use to communicate to theÂ Â  audience then it's about your marketing strategyÂ 
a lot of people think that the brand strategy andÂ Â  the marketing strategy are running the same theyÂ 
are not now it's about understanding where yourÂ Â  audience is congregating where are they onlineÂ 
where are they physically and how are we goingÂ Â  to engage them on the front lines of the marketÂ 
what are they going to respond to and how are weÂ Â  going to draw them in do we have a funnel areÂ 
we going to guide them along every step of theÂ Â  journey until they become a customer so thinkingÂ 
about all those different steps of the funnel allÂ Â  those different potential channels and platformsÂ 
that we can use to engage is super important inÂ Â  getting your brand out there into the market it'sÂ 
not just about building the vehicle it's aboutÂ Â  understanding where that vehicle must go in orderÂ 
to appeal to your audience now look at the end ofÂ Â  the day as I said in the beginning branding isÂ 
simply about making a business more appealingÂ Â  to a certain group of people so that they chooseÂ 
that business over the other businesses that areÂ Â  in the market offering similar products orÂ 
services so really thinking about who yourÂ Â  audience is and what they're going to respond to IÂ 
can't emphasize how important that is because yourÂ Â  brand is not about you your brand is not for youÂ 
your brand is owned by your audience because it'sÂ Â  a perception it's not a tangible thing it doesn'tÂ 
live on a billboard or a website or even in yourÂ Â  office it lives out there in the marketplace as aÂ 
perception and all we can do as brand builders isÂ Â  try to influence that perception as best we canÂ 
so if you think about your brand and branding inÂ Â  those terms as something that is out there inÂ 
the market that your audience is going to formÂ Â  by themselves then we can think about how canÂ 
we help them to form that perception and thatÂ Â  what is what branding is about at the end of theÂ 
day it's about understanding that your brand isÂ Â  a perception and all we have as brand builders isÂ 
the ability to try and influence that perceptionÂ Â  through our position through our differentiationÂ 
through our personality our messages our storiesÂ Â  and our visual identity when you understand whatÂ 
branding is from that perspective you have theÂ Â  tools at your disposal to be able to influenceÂ 
your audience now if you want to dive deeperÂ Â  into brand strategy then this video here willÂ

Futur,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrM5CRg-O0I,let's talk about marketing yourself the secret to make content easier is to tell your story to embrace your own uniqueness tell us your story who wants to know my story so boring there's nothing here and divert your attention elsewhere and i get that feeling so i'm there with you this is the question that came up in one of our recent call in the program i feel like uh if i for just keep telling my stories and i'm not focusing on being a brand strategist and talking about brand strategy then people won't get that i'm a band strategist oh that's very interesting so this is where i'm gonna say to you this is a long game it's the infinite game and if you try to think one effort equals one client i think you're gonna play a different game you're gonna play the game of advertising and you're just going to talk about your services and your products and your offerings all the time and to a point you have to do that but i i don't think that's how you're going to build a community and the one of the best people that i know about uh who does branding is aaron draplin and all he's all he does is tells his personal story all all the time and you get to know who he is and what better way than for you at some point in the near future in the next three to six months to build organically an audience that shows up for you as a person who tells their story in open and transparent and vulnerable ways that's empowering and enriching the lives of others to say shouldn't we pay attention to mahi since she does such a wonderful job of branding herself couldn't we use that talent for us and why aren't we smart enough to hire her okay play the long game remember it's not about transaction it's more about transformation and if you can do that you're gonna create so much more value for yourself the long-term plan is to make it easier for people to find you than your competitor to make people fall in love with who you are as a creative human being and then to hire you for the services you want to sell them or the products you want to sell right now we're just at the beginning stages of helping you find your voice in the world and to get used to creating content in a way that's not overly taxing on time commitment and it's really just the easiest thing to do which is to tell your story find parts in your life to share with other people that are lessons learned keep doing that if you guys need a prompt this is an easy prompt think about every person who taught you a lesson tell that story because they were the mentor in your story okay long term it's a content gameplay for you to develop marketing skills and if you trust me i hope you do if you trust me i will take you to the promised land but you have to do this work it takes time this is not an overnight scheme it's not it's work it's hard and i want it to be hard and i want it to be hard work i've tried many different ways to get you there and this is my latest scheme i will call it a scheme because that's what it is let's talk about something here and i want to wrap up last week somebody reached out and asked me if i'm interested in doing i think it's called jumpstart for entrepreneurs organization and if you know anything about eo i've been to one of their meetings before to be a member of eo i think you have to make more than a million dollars a year and the average that people make as entrepreneurs in eo is five plus million dollars and they found me through instagram this woman who's in charge of learning she has a master's or phd in in teaching and she's i think in south america she reached out and she's like we would like to inquire to see if you're interested in teaching an influencer social influence thing for our eo members all over the world and it's been a very interesting discussion so she just sent an email to me last night and said look we don't have a lot of money to do this but we can start with ten thousand dollars for you to teach us [Music] to create a 21-day program where there's a lot of self-study and then some some lectures that you do maybe three lectures or three meetings with us and i thought this is so wonderful and of course i asked her how did you find me and she's like i just searched like business influence something and you just popped up all over the place so what i'm talking about right now in answer to mahi's question is we are like johnny appleseed we're planting a lot of seeds some will bear fruit some will die some will wither away but we have to plant those seeds and when you want to collect the fruits of your labor will be months sometimes years from now but the work needs to be done today if you wanted to bear fruit it does take time and i'm very excited because imagine at some point somebody's probably paying money to be in front of a global community of millionaires think how powerful that is and to position yourself as a person who can teach something that they might find to be valuable see how this game works you plant the seeds today you gotta plant those seeds and i'm gonna help you step by step we'll get there together i hope

xwwC4tC5jF8,How to Develop a Social Media Strategy: Step-by-Step Tutorial,Unknown,121400,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xwwC4tC5jF8/hq720.jpg,2022-05-17 00:00:00,1505,Gillian Perkins,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwwC4tC5jF8,these days it is standard practice to use social media marketing if you're running a business pretty much every online business and most offline businesses as well try to use social media to get customers online however the sad truth is that especially most small businesses don't really have any sort of strategy they are just posting content randomly or trying to copy their competitors and the end result is that they don't create any real results meaning it doesn't affect their bottom line positively and that it's a massive waste of time because we all know how time-consuming social media can be my name is gillian perkins i'm an online business strategist and i specialize in digital marketing strategy i'm also the founder of startup society which is an online training program for digital entrepreneurs in this video i'm going to teach you the process that i use to develop our social media strategy every year and this is how i've created the strategy that has grown our followers on social media to at this point over a million followers which is a pretty good size audience it's also the strategy that we use inside of startup society and we guide the members through to help them develop social media strategies for their businesses now you can use this strategy for yourself to either create your own social media strategy for your own business or if you happen to be a virtual assistant or a social media manager or you want to become one of those things you could use this as a framework for creating strategy for your clients and you could work through this framework with your clients to create that strategy okay so the very first step is to just make sure that you're starting with the right mindset aside from not having a strategy when people do create a strategy there are two big mistakes that they make really often the first is that too often they focus on results or metrics that simply don't matter they don't think they're vanity metrics because they think they're measuring things like clicks or comments not just vanity metrics like impressions but the fact of the matter is that even clicks or comments they aren't what you really want most likely most likely you really want to drive more profit in your company and that's what your clients will want too if you're doing social media management for clients so first of all just make sure that you aren't making the mistake of focusing on just bigger and just trying to grow your audience bigger and just trying to get more views those things are important and they help your other metrics to be more successful because if you do have a good strategy and you are converting your followers into paying customers then having more followers of course will help but just make sure that you know where that end outcome is we'll talk more about that in just a minute but the other mistake that you need to make sure that you avoid is too often when people decide to formally create a social media strategy and no longer are we going to do this by the seat of our pants now we are going to instead think about things ahead of time and be strategic they think that that means that it needs to be a full feature social media strategy they need to have a strategy for every single platform they need to be on every single platform and maybe they even need to be using all the features on every single platform so for example if they want to use instagram as one of their platforms then they think that means they have to use instagram feed posts and instagram stories and instagram reels and maybe they need to take advantage of those instagram guides and run instagram ads as well and that's simply not the case the most solid strategic smart social media plan isn't the one that goes super broad it's the one that's very strategic wherever you are and that doesn't mean you need to be everywhere you truly can be on just one or two or three platforms and do that really well and that is going to get you much bigger results than trying to be everywhere so don't try to do a good job by trying to be everywhere instead be strategic and be thoughtful about this and choose the platforms that will really be the best fit for you and your business and your goals and where you like to show up and create content the next step for creating your social media strategy is to set goals i was just talking about how it's important that you focus on results and that your strategy is results oriented well there are so many different kinds of results you could get but you will only get the right results and the results you really want if you know what you want and that starts with knowing what your goals are so before you even start thinking about social media think about your business what are your current business goals now of course you'll want to make more money you want to do it in less time you want to do it more easily but i'm thinking more specifically than that like specifically what product do you want to sell more of and how many units of that product do you want to sell and then as you're thinking about that product you want to sell well what are your goals that relate to how you'll sell that product like do you need to attract more potential new customers or do you need to communicate with the leads you already have more effectively and what are the real like things that you need to communicate to those people in order to get them interested in buying so get really granular with this think about really specific goals and then let those business goals inform your social media goals so for example if you want to attract one-on-one clients for your virtual assistant services well you don't need a whole lot of customers in that case if you're serving these people one-on-one as a freelancer so instead you need to focus on attracting just the right people and you need to make sure that you're building real relationships with them then you have to think about how you're going to measure that so with this goal for example you might measure it by how many people are filling out your inquiry form each week and that's going to be more focused on the business side of things and your business metrics over on social media it could be how many people click to visit your intake form and then you can also measure the conversion rate there now on the other hand maybe you have an e-commerce brand and you want to sell thousands of units of a certain product every month let's say you make handmade jewelry for example and you want to sell this is your specific business goal you want to sell more of your raw crystal necklaces okay so what do you need to do in order to accomplish that goal well over on social media your goal might be to just get more impressions and this is just part of your goal you know but just to get more impressions of people actually looking at and seeing your jewelry because you might know that while impressions certainly can be just a vanity metric in your case you might find that the more people who see your jewelry the more people buy so you might be tracking impressions and you also might be then tracking the clicks over to your website and of course also the actual purchases of that specific product also just keep in mind that your strategy on social media and your budget on social media are going to be strongly influenced by both what your goal is but also by the size of your goal and on the timeline for your goal so for this i like to use the acronym ost for outcome size and timeline you need to know what the ost for your goal is so with the jewelry business for example the outcome is they want to sell more of their raw crystal necklaces the size is currently they're selling 100 units a month they want to sell 300 units a month and as far as the timeline the question is like do we want to accomplish this over the next week or two in that case we will need to have a very intense strategy and probably a significant budget as well or are you planning to accomplish this over the next six months in that case you can probably accomplish it organically and as long as your strategy is solid it doesn't need to be too frantic now the next step that i'd recommend that you do is just to assess your current results so the reason why this is important is because you are about to change a bunch of things and you will want to measure whether or not those things are working and how well they're working so that you can adjust from there and so that you can feel good about your progress or you can figure out that you need to change things a different way so you need to look at your current stats and you need to see how many followers you have on each platform and the average number of impressions and likes and clicks and all those different things for your posts and you'll want to record those metrics so that you'll be able to look back on this in the future and compare and contrast the fourth step is to determine who your target market is so part of this whole social media strategy is that you are going to be trying to find certain people to eventually sell them your product or get them on your email list or something like that and it is so much easier to find these people if you know who you are looking for so this starts with thinking about things like who are your current customers and do you want to attract more people who are just like your current customers or do you want to attract a different group of people because maybe for some reason these people aren't really the best fit like even though they buy your product they're also a hassle or they buy your product but they don't buy it in the volume that a different group of people might buy it or something like that so think about just who you want to attract then you'll want to think about more specific things like demographics and this is stuff like age and gender and where in the world they live and their income level things like that and then you'll also want to think about interests like what are your current customers into or the people who you want to attract what are they into is there specific books or movies or apps or even just like interest like hobbies and things like that that they are interested in now you might have a lot of this information about these people and you might not have a lot of it either way is fine but the more closely you can pinpoint this person the easier it will be for you to find them on social media another great thing to look at and consider is who your current followers are they might be the people you want to attract or maybe not but they can potentially give you some insights into who is interested in your content the next part of creating a social media strategy is to research your competitors now you might think of these people as competitors or not mostly i'm talking about kind of the big players in your industry the successful brands in your industry you also might have specific competitors but basically we want to use this for research purposes we want to see what's working for your competitors so that you can cut your learning curve a little bit and you can create a more solid social media strategy earlier on so first this starts with just identifying competitors you might know these off the top of your head or you might have to do a little bit of digging and then after you know who the competitors are you'll want to look and see what platforms are those competitors on and then the main thing i want you to focus on after you've figured that out is analyzing their current content how frequently are they posting what are they posting and how is their audience responding to those posts this can give you tons of good ideas and important data on what you'll want to post on your accounts once you've researched your competitors then you'll kind of want to research yourself so by this i mean if you already have a social media presence if you have been posting you'll want to assess what you have been doing and what has been working and what hasn't so you'll want to look through your recent posts from the last few months and see which ones are getting more engagement and which ones are getting clicks versus just likes or just impressions and you'll just want to see how different things are performing so that you can decide what you want to keep in your new social media strategy versus what needs to change now i would highly recommend here that you actually go in and look at these numbers and you don't just do it by your gut instinct because a lot of the time we feel like certain things are working or not working but when we actually go into the numbers and look at them we find out that our instinct was wrong personally i noticed this with my youtube videos for example sometimes i post videos and they seem to do great and then other times i post videos and they seem to not do so well and so i just remember that kind of initial impression and so later on i'll feel like oh my audience wasn't so interested in that topic but then if i go in and actually look at the numbers i'll find out that over time certain videos performed really well in search even if they didn't initially hit it out of the park with my current subscribers and so i'll discover that a topic that i thought was a flop ended up getting hundreds of thousands of views and i actually should make more videos on that topic so just make sure you actually look at the numbers when you do this step and assess your current results so now that you've done a lot of research and you've made some decisions about who you're following and all of that now it's time to actually start making some decisions the first decision you'll want to make is just what platforms do you want to be on now of course there's a lot of different things you can consider here a couple of the biggest ones i think are first of all which platforms are already working for you if you have a platform that you're already getting some traction on then you'll want to strongly consider making that one of your main platforms another thing to consider is which platform you most enjoy being on because the truth is that especially if you are a solopreneur or you have a small team and you're going to be doing a lot of this yourself you'll have to spend a lot of time on that platform in order to really turn it into a success and you will be much less inclined to do that if you choose a platform that you're not that crazy about even if technically that would be the right platform for you and then another thing you'll want to consider is strategically which one makes the most sense for you and your goals so for example if you really need to attract a ton of new customers new leads and you don't have an audience right now well you'll need to think about which platforms it will be easiest to get that exposure on and so you might think about search driven platforms like youtube and pinterest and maybe even tick-tock you also might think about running paid ads on the other hand if you need to develop relationships with your current audience and you already have a bit of a following well then you might look at a platform like instagram or twitter but you also could use a platform like youtube you also might want to make blogging and an email newsletter part of your strategy because you need to have those conversations and build those relationships with people who already know you exist so you don't need so much the new exposure you need more to have the conversations the number one thing i think you should ignore here although this is really common advice is where are your customers honestly this doesn't matter because your customers unless you have a super super niche target market they're gonna be on every platform to some extent and well yes maybe they hang out more on twitch than on youtube or more on instagram than on pinterest there will be some of them on every platform and not only that but if you go to the place where the most of them are hanging out that's also where you're going to find the most competition and so that's good because there's lots of them there but bad because competition and then on the other hand you can choose a platform where there's fewer of them but also less competition and so again that's good because there's less competition and it's okay that there's fewer of them and so honestly these things end up balancing each other out and it doesn't matter that much and what matters so much more is which platform you actually enjoy and choosing a platform that does fit your strategy so your target market your people they're everywhere but they will be doing different things on different platforms and so while yes they're on tick tock and they're also on youtube the thing is that on tick tock maybe they're just scrolling and they're just looking for entertainment and they're just trying to pass the time and they don't really develop strong trust with the people they find on tick tock but over on youtube maybe they're more serious and like more focused on education and learning and they see the people who they discover on youtube as experts now that's just an example i'm not saying that's necessarily exactly the way it is but people interact with different platforms and different content differently so you'll need to think about how that plays into your strategy when you are choosing which platforms to be on okay so we've made it all the way to step number eight and we're almost there to the end but this is where the real creative work starts happening so now for step number eight you need to generate content ideas now for some people this is the easiest funnest step like finally they're getting their hands dirty and for other people this is like the pull and teeth part so hard either way though my biggest tip is to try to come up with a lot of ideas now i know that that might sound like not so much a tip if you're like but coming up with ideas is the problem but honestly when you stretch yourself and you start just brainstorming and kind of pull back your filters and just dump your ideas onto the page then the ideas start coming faster and faster and more and more easily and there is no harder time to come up with an idea than when it is the day to post and you need to come up with something on the spot right then so by coming up with a ton of ideas early on before you're even thinking about actually creating the content or posting it that will be the very easiest time and it will again help to get the wheels turning and help to just open up your mind to all the different ideas so whichever platforms you chose i'd recommend that you just sit down with a google doc or a pad of paper and you just start brainstorming ideas and there's two parts to this one is have a big brainstorming session maybe even two or three brainstorming sessions and then secondly whenever you think of an idea make sure you write it down because this will keep those wheels turning and make sure you do this separately for each platform you might realize that you can use certain ideas on multiple platforms but they're going to look differently and honestly you will probably on some platforms have much longer larger pieces of content and then on other platforms they'll be much shorter and so you want to make sure that you're really thinking strategically about those different platforms because that is key for getting your content to perform well on each of those different platforms the next step is pretty easy although i think a lot of people make this the whole point of their social media strategy it's just to choose your posting frequency and then create a schedule so for example you might decide that you want to post on the main instagram feed once a day and you also want to post a real every other day now honestly this matters way less than a lot of people think the important things here are first of all that you decide this ahead of time so you can be consistent and also volume does matter now it's more important to create quality content than to create tons of content because you can create a million pieces of mediocre content nobody will care but if you create one piece of standout absolute stellar content that people love well they will share it and they will be really interested in working with you so quality is way more important that being said on most platforms in order to really work with the algorithm and get it to give you some exposure you do need to create a certain volume so over on instagram for example that means just that you need to be posting consistently several times a week although a lot of instagram experts do say that you want to post at least about once a day if you really want your account to grow easily and then over here on youtube most of the time you do need to post at least about once a week because if you post less than that then it just takes way too long to get traction with the algorithm now if you create super exceptional content then you might be able to define these rules but when it comes to creating a social media strategy i'd recommend that you at least meet kind of those minimum volume thresholds because it'll just make your job a lot easier the tenth and final step is absolutely key honestly you could do all those other steps and then your social media strategy could just like fall flat on its face if you don't do this last step and the reason is because you can have tons of ideas you can know when you want to post but it can be so hard to follow through and actually create the content and to get it posted on in a timely way if you don't have a system for creating that content so you need to have a system you need to have a routine and so what this looks like really is setting up some sort of project management software you might already have something like this going you might choose to just use google calendar or something but i'm talking about something like trello or asana or click up or notion something like that so that you can manage these projects of creating the content and you can have due dates the two main systems you'll want to set up is first of all a content calendar where you decide ahead of time what needs to be created and you put it on the calendar with scheduled publishing dates and second of all some sort of production workflow where you're able to move the content through a production process as you come up with the ideas and you outline the content and you take the pictures or record the videos and the content gets edited if needed and then eventually someone publishes it so this is just the easiest way to make sure that all those steps get done in a timely way also if you're creating longer more substantial pieces of content like blog posts or podcasts or youtube videos you might want to have a routine around this where for example every monday you're recording and then you edit on tuesday and wednesday and you post your video on thursday just for example having a routine like this just makes it way easier to be consistent and actually get it done without having to constantly feel like you're trying to motivate yourself to find the time to get it done okay so there you have it 10 steps for creating your own strategic social media plan now there's one last important step and this isn't a part of creating the strategy but you shouldn't skip this and it is just to constantly be listening and to be actually monitoring those metrics and to be adjusting as needed you might feel like if you get this right you won't have to do it or if you knew what you were doing you wouldn't have to do this but honestly this is what the social media pros do they don't get it right the first time they come up with a pretty good plan and then they listen and they adjust accordingly and if you want to create a great social media strategy then that's what you need to do you need to learn from your mistakes learn from what's working and adjust and this is a never-ending process your social media strategy will never be perfected because people's interests and what they're responding to is always changing and the platforms are always changing so don't feel like you did it wrong if you need to adjust keep your eyes open and always be learning from what is working if you enjoyed this

eyxL02Q990E,How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy in 2024 | Step-by-Step Guide,Unknown,24427,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eyxL02Q990E/hq720.jpg,2024-01-19 00:00:00,940,Milou Pietersz,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyxL02Q990E,in the social media industry the word strategy gets tossed around a whole lot but do you as a social media manager really know how to create a killer content strategy for your clients that gets them fast and great results well after today's video I promise you're going to feel confident in creating a social media marketing strategy for clients in my seven steps now with the skills that you will learn today you will be able to actually charge the big buck hey my name is Mill and I own a multi6 fig social media agency and I now help social media managers do the same if you're new here and you're an aspiring sixf figure social media manager make sure to grab my road map to becoming a sixf figure social media manager that I will link right here now let's dive in the first step in creating a killer content strategy for your clients is by conducting research now a great portion of creating a strategy in general is going to be research now while this may seem boring this is really going to help set you up for Success because you need to know what you're working with now there are a couple of different ways you can conduct research you know one of the most common ways is through social media itself right where you're looking at different accounts in their industry their own accounts but you need to gather data on a lot of different aspects that have to do with the client right so I'm going to show you a way that I like to conduct research myself and through different tools so I like to actually use Sam rush to conduct research on social media by using their social media tools now back in the day these were actually free I've mentioned them before in different videos but this is actually now a pay tool but if you're just looking for the social media insides from Sam rush I believe it's around $20 a month I can link them in the description but what I like to do here is I would like to look at all the different insights and analytics of my client right and I need to get an idea of what are they doing well what aren't they doing well what does their current content strategy look like and you can see all of that here in in Sam so here I can see in the last 30 days I can see exactly how often my client posts so they post half a time a day so that's 14 in an entire month I can see the kind of post they do so mainly reals here and carousels and so that way I can gather so much data on why something isn't working for them when they mention that in a call right I can see their engagement rate and what types of Engagement they get and I can compare them also to other competitors which we'll dive into later but I do wanted to show you that you can gather a bunch of data here specifically in Sam Rush that I prefer to use other tools that you can use is one that I like to use from time to time is ninja ltic ninja ltic is quite a common tool too and it has similar insights I will say but one thing I like to check on ninja litic specifically like if I use my my own name is you can find someone's engagement rate and things like that now the reason why that's actually so important in the research phase that you take note of all these things is because you want to compare the data in 30 days in 60 days in 90 days right so you need to have these insights so that you can showcase the client what's going on where you can see the growth which I really like on ninja LS as well the follower growth and so you can go back into certain dates I think they have Italian English here so if I go back in here you can see like on this date this was January 4th I gained a lot of followers so I can go back into that day and actually look okay what did I do that day that made me gain these followers right the number of posts you can see here as well and the weekly and monthly followers and account gains as well as hashtags that the account use so you want to gather again as much data as you can about an account so that you can then set yourself up for Success see what's working in in the industry as a whole things that are doing well on social media and doing not so well before you dive into anything else right gather as much data as possible here now if you're wondering how I create monthly analytics reports for clients I actually do have a full video on that where I'll also go over data and how to interpret it so check it out right here and let me know what you think now the second step in creating a killer content strategy for your clients is by setting the expectations now how do you do this in the onboarding phase I specifically ask clients what are your goals what are the business goals I'm not even asking them for their social media goals cuz I am the expert at the end of the day right they hired me for my expertise so I'm simply asking them what are your business goals and how do you see social media play into that to work towards these goals because here's the thing let's say a client wants to increase their revenue right and all they do is posted DRS they get great engagement they get a lot of reach but they're not making a single sale and they're content strategy needs to be tweaked right now let's say someone is just looking to create brand awareness then maybe yes you do want to go very heavy on the reals in order to get their name out there because you're not that focused on generating the sales at that point right that's why getting their goals and their expectations is so important so that you can align the content strategy accordingly so something that I like to do in my marketing strategies is I will line up the goals they mentioned for the business then I will line up the social media goals on how I see social media work towards these goals right whether it doesn't matter the time frame but how we're going to work towards these goals and then I like to line up the metrics on how do we measure success right from a social media standpoint how do we know that we as a team have done our job now I cannot emphasize how important this is enough because what you will see is that if you don't do this and you're not on the same page the expectations aren't there then within three or six months either you the client is going to be disappointed at where they're at because you haven't had that conversation so setting goals is so important because it will determine your entire content strategy now if you want to know how I create a general social media strategy I do have a post about that as well that you can check out right here with a step-by-step guide into the social media strategy now the third step in creating a killer content strategy for your clients is by spying on the competition now I don't want you to completely get carried away looking at other accounts right and going into the comparison trap but it is important for you to know what's out there and also it can provide a lot of clarity what I've had before with clients is that in the onboarding session they were not sure about certain things I'd given them advice you know they're still unsure what direction to go with certain things and that's when it's a good time to pull up competitors because that's when you can say hey this is what that person is doing they seem very successful with it we should take a Chapter out of their book or hey look at what they're doing and take little things from everyone and put it together into your own strategy so again here is how I like to do the competitor analysis and again I'm gathering data it's still research right but again I go back into Sam Rush here because they offer so much data so if you are inside the social media tools of Sam rush they have under social tracker what you can actually do is when you open a project here you can add in competitors so here you'll see I have my account here that's called you and then I I can add anyone else that I want to add and you can compare your activity your engagement your audience to the competitors and this is just so valuable because you can see exactly what they're doing you can see their best performing post and you don't even have to be hooked up to their account so again super valuable insights into their content strategy so that you can still the things that they're doing well right so this is a big big part of your content strategy because you need to know what they're doing well and not doing well and another reason why this is so important is because if one month your client may feel like who our engagement is low our story views are low nothing is quote unquote working what you can do is you can compare them to their competitor and say Hey you know we're actually doing the best out of our competitors in terms of engagement right so you want to look at competitor that are within their range I do want to emphasize that so you don't want to compare a startup to an account with a million followers right because it's not a fair comparison but you want to keep the competitors kind of within their range and a good variety so that you can pick and choose different things from each of them and that way they have an overlap they have things in common and you can create a well-rounded content strategy now the fourth step in creating a killer content strategy for your clients is by auditing their current content strategy now whether your client has an actual strategy in place or not you can still learn a lot from whatever they have been posting and doing right every post we put up gathers data and it gives us valuable insights so you want to technically go into their account at that point when you have access and let's say we take Instagram right you want to go into their insights where you can see exactly what has been working for them so I like to go to insights content I've shared and then what you can say is you can say the last 6 months let's say that is a good time frame gives you a bunch of data and it's not too far back to where there's a lot old content now what you can do you can filter these by different metrics right by shares accounts now actually what also if you put it on posts what you will see that's when you will get more options on the metric so now you can see okay what got them the most saves so now I can see exactly oh this type of content is getting me the most saves so maybe I should trade more of that type of content right or what type of content is getting them the most follows and then again I will see exactly the type of content that is getting them the most follows so depending on their goals you now know things that they have been doing well and sometimes what I do is I like to repurpose content they they have done that well but could do even better so you're going to optimize the content and see how it performs the second time around but other thing what they have currently been doing is key because even though they don't have a strategy or didn't really know what they were doing you can still learn a ton from the insights that they have in their current account or whoever whoever has been managing their account now if you want to know how I myself create over 30 pieces of content within 10 minutes and I show you the exact system on how I do it then check out this video it will help you a ton now the fifth step into creating a killer content strategy for your client is by creating a cont content funnel as I like to call it now your client does need to have a basic funnel in place in order to set you up for Success right so a couple of things that a basic funnel have is a lead magnet like a free download of some sort to get people into the funnel into their email list a low ticket offer preferably this could be a course maybe a bundle templates anything and then an application for whatever High ticket offer they have now I do realize this is for mainstream service based business right this will be different for e-commerce but again you need to have these pieces in place for any any funnel so this is something important because when you're looking at the content funnel I like the basis of top of funnel middle of funnel and bottom of funnel so you have three different boxes and three different types of content you want to be creating in order to get people into your client funnel right so top of funnel is the awareness type of content as I like to call it this may be the reals the trends the fun things that attract a lot of eyes right the middle of the funnel this is where you want to educate people already are aware of you but they want to learn more they want to dig deeper they want to know they can trust you and what you know and then lastly bottom of funnel is really the promotional content this is where you convert them into a customer at the end of the day right so again it's really hard to have a Content funnel if your client doesn't have a funnel in place and that would be a huge risk for them unless their goal is simply to exist and be active on social media they need to have a funnel in place so that you can create the content funnel now if you want to know all the dos and Dons of 2024 for social media management then make sure you catch up on this video that I launched at the end of 23 that gives you all the insights that you need to know this year now the sixth step in creating a killer content strategy is by creating content pillars the content funnel simply itself isn't enough you still wouldn't know what to to talk about necessarily right you know the type of content you want to create but you need to have the specific topics for this business for your client that you will regularly touch on it really depends on the client and and the things that are important to them so for example for myself social media strategy is a big one that I often talk about social media management Instagram so these are all different topics that I touch on and depending on the client you want to add these in and give a little bit of a description on what that would look like and then you don't have to worry that you feel limited to these pillars because each pillar can have a bunch of sub topics underneath them because of course social media strategy is very broad right this can entail Instagram strategy this can be social media manager versus social media strategist this can be a quote there's a lot of things that go underneath that main topic but you need to have these different Topics in play so that you can actually audit later on what topics have been doing well so the seventh step into creating a killer content strategy for your client is by experimenting now that you have all these pieces in place that I've mentioned in today's video I need you to execute create the content but remember that I need you to experiment now an important part of executing the content strategy that you come up with is that you need to know your platforms okay Instagram isn't the same as LinkedIn LinkedIn isn't the same as YouTube YouTube isn't the same as Tik Tok right different things work on different platforms so you want to optimize accordingly but always make sure you stay experimenting so that you can learn what works best for each account and that brings me also to Instagram specifically where some accounts simply Drive of reals they convert they get a lot of reach and if it does well for them you know don't fix it don't fix what isn't broken but otherwise you need to really figure out what are we going after the goals that we set in the previous step and how are we able to get to their goal with the content we create through the content funnel right so again all of these steps together will form a killer content strategy that you can execute experiment with and adjust over time no strategy is ever set in stone as you know this is a very fast-paced industry so you want to leave room for experimenting along the

like Gary TV works for me I'm like you spent six million dollars on that campaign I'm like it should work that's why most brands are losing they're wrong you're absolutely right you know like I I can't imagine being a common sense human being in September 2022 and not understanding that brand is built on social I I genuinely mean that I mean I don't you know you'd have to be so subconsciously religious about what you were taught in college about how brands are built to be anyone that doesn't see it and so My Philosophy is why would you spend money on something if you can spend less money to achieve the same goal so I love when people like Gary TV works for me I'm like you spent six million dollars on that campaign I'm like it should work I'm like the question is did you spend six million dollars on creative and media in Tick Tock YouTube Facebook Pinterest influencers podcast like YouTube like what would happen if you actually spent that same money perfectly in the Contemporary environments and so you know it's weird because I've been on this journey for 15 years um and I was incredibly empathetic the first seven years because I knew people didn't know but I literally have dinners now with decision makers who will spend the first 30 minutes talking about how social media can completely controls their child's life then they'll spend the next 15 minutes talking about politics and how social media needs to be regulated because of how powerful it is as a proxied against democracy and then we'll transition into talking about selling cereal and makeup and they don't think social media can move the needle I'm like so let me get this straight you think this platform is so powerful that we need to regulate it because it could put democracy on its knees but you don't think it can sell cereal and so you know my point of view is that it's the most underpriced macro platform to get actual consumption it's also a place if you understand it well that really addresses the elephant in the room which is the elephant in the room in marketing today is that creative's too expensive and because it's too expensive you can't actually get the full advantage of the media opportunities that exist if it costs you too much to make creative you're not going to make 87 pieces of creative a day to distribute against 35 different consumer segmentations against 21 social platforms you'll never do that you can't and so yeah I mean to me in 2022 it's kind of an exhausting conversation to even like like I'm struggling to get going to even be in the combo because I can't understand how people don't see it the only thing that makes sense to me is when people are in corporations and the internal scoring system doesn't justify it then I understand you're trying to protect your job and you should you have a mortgage and a family but if we're talking real life like human beings like our kids health depends on the results how you don't understand that this is the place that Brand's built I don't know this is Facebook Twitter and Tumblr stock I made a very big bet 15 years ago where I took every dollar I had in the bank and invested in three companies Facebook Twitter and Tumblr obviously that changed the course of my life but the funny story of why I'm pointing here it's actually the answer to your question when I invested in Tumblr I called my brother and I said AJ Tumblr is going to be bigger than Facebook and Twitter it's gonna be the biggest one of them all and he said why and I said because Facebook and Twitter you follow people Tumblr you follow things you're interested in and so even back then I was fascinated by the interest graph over the social graph now that didn't become true because there's a lot of other variables to why a company will be successful including who's operating it but what is true is that what Tick Tock has tapped into in the last three years has completely changed and will change everything we're all doing and is the answer to your question the way it's changed is the following now not now art not math is the most important equation in doing creative on social the algorithms now reward retention more than ever which means they're going to show you things you want right things you want are far more predicated on the creative than the math that gets them in front of you instead of the Facebook environment we all grew up with where you could get in front of the people you wanted to based on great data and then you would pound them with advertising what we need to win on now is creative that is advertising that is educating or entertaining AKA creating consideration then once that is proven then we can convert Those ads to Performance ads but we have to start with the creative instead of what everybody here knows which is the creative has been a secondary part of the equation which is why we spend 80 percent of our money on the media and 20 on the creative and as many people here know people haven't really been doing marketing and branding they've been doing sales if you look at the creative of the DTC Brands over the last 15 years it's much more couponing and and and newspaper advertising than it is marketing that has completely changed in the last three to four years and everybody here has to leave with two things one we need to actually get into the creative business and make things that people want to watch two we need to make it for many different consumer segmentations this is not television where you make a piece of vanilla and you hope that everybody on Earth wants it this is Baskin Robbins and we need to make a lot of different flavors and go up and then see the common ground and then understand what our brand stands for based on 37 different consumer segmentations of relevance once you can understand the upside down model of how brands are built because the internet now rules not the television then you can really start to understand what to do web 3.0 um is really slang for the consumer blockchain and why the brands should care about it is if they are a brand that does not want to transact on their business AKA sell it in the next five years then they should really care because it's 1999 2000 all over again and 2005 internet was a hell of a lot more important than 99 internet and 2000 what are we in 22 and 2027 nfts are going to matter a hell of a lot more than 2022 nfts so why you have to care is it is my deep belief that what I saw the internet do to communication starting in 1996 and being in every day is exactly what the consumer blockchain is about to do for transaction that everybody here thinking about first party data sustainable e-commerce with high cost shipping AKA how do we get people into memberships and monthly and and packages instead of one-off skus and a million other things that you think about day to day the blockchain's better at solving it than the internet most people even in this room which is which I highly respect and this is not a Razz this is being empathetic that people are busy and haven't had the time to spend 50 hours on it most people even in this room haven't really synthesized their strategies on the fact that the internet is different from the blockchain and if you haven't done that then you don't even understand the functionality of the blockchain and how do I know this because it's what happened with people in The Logical real world were unable to do with the internet when I was pitching wine library.com in 1996 literally everybody who I talked to said to me who would ever go on the internet to buy a bottle of wine I can go to the store and get it and my response was everyone and so what what and that blew people's [Â __Â ] mind in 1996 right because we still had people and you all know this almost every single person on this calls parents was scared to put a credit card into a computer in 1999. and so what we're seeing now with people's fear like most people in this room that [Â __Â ] on nfts if they do don't realize that they've become their parents right they're they're demonizing a technology without fully understanding it and so for me I actually think nfts are going to be one of the most significant Innovations in cpg land because when I see nfts my brain goes to LTV it goes to retention it goes to event marketing it goes to monthly subscription it goes to how I'm going to control first party data and not be at the mercy of Google Facebook and Tick Tock when you do your 50 hours things get real different real fast and that would be my takeaway here you know unfortunately we just ended this summer where you probably could have snuck it in but if you're listening and you understand the macro of what I'm saying please use the winter holidays to really actually actually read on what a blockchain does how it is a ledger that affirms a transaction that nobody on Earth can alter and what impact that has and then you are the currency I am the central bank to be friends I collect the royalties I have the affirmation I'm not at Mercy of any technology stack or government stack this is a big deal it's a big deal but it's internet 1996 and people are glossing over it especially because we have the internet this time last time we didn't even have the internet yet so it's a very important very important technology that I think can really matter especially for some of the creative people here who are interested in General Mills or the Leo Burnett era of the 60s where you create characters and the value of those characters like I'm very into that and so if you're if you know there's a very big reason I'm passionate about this technology I understand the macro of the transaction thing to the communication thing I just referenced I'm also highly affected by character development the Marlboro Man Keebler elves things of that nature and I I see nfts as a substantial playground for that these characters you see back here my Disney be friends I fully intend to building a multi-billion Dollar cpg business that looks like Fruity pal bills or Mary Ruth's Organics or things of that nature what why I'm very empathetic for so many people being confused is I live in this every day and I've been watching it since 2017 quietly when when crypto kitties hit and like I've been watching and waiting for my timing of the entry which obviously was about 18 months ago the reality is ninety percent of the people that were in it last year were there for the quick buck and that DNA is very off-putting to people that are in things for so unlike the internet which it was in 95 and 6 where the crew was a bunch of nerds that nobody fully understood what the hell they were talking about that's one version of like a niche that you gotta kind of like understand how to use this one was very difficult because there was so much money involved and get rich quick and scams and like all the worst Dynamics more like extreme Wall Street Dynamics which is why we had Internet stock issues in the 90s and then on top of everything else you have social media so you have all these people gloating hey I bought a donkey with a cigar up its ass and made 400 000 what normal human being thinks that's a good thing and so I was very empathetic to the confusion I continue to be empathetic to the confusion but let there be no confusion the consumer blockchain is the biggest invention since the internet and every person in this room is going to be highly affected by it because all of you will pay your taxes and buy future homes on it so you better figure it out because when you made fun of your mom for not using email or a smartphone you're literally about to be that person with the blockchain in the next decade so I highly recommend you figure it out I do think believe it or not the luxury brands are a little bit ahead because they're thinking about loyalty and retention what you're seeing from lvmh and others in my opinion without knowing everything that they're thinking but watching carefully I do think they have a sense of wait a minute this is an opportunity for us to create communities things like Amex Black Card like I I see certain nuances there so if I was to tell you all to look I'm always scared at this early of a stage to say go look at Puma because it's really hard to understand what it all means what I would say is get grounded in the underlining technology then you can do your damage you'll understand how it works for you the problem is when I look at internal teams across the board it's a pretty bad sich because most people are mailing it in and they're either blindly DTC and want it to be sales and that's how the creatives being justified or if they're even flirting with creative they just think the 24 year old knows what to do on Tick Tock and so they're not even evaluating it so we have an acronym internally at Vayner called sock strategic organic content and all day long I just walk around on slack email and in the halls and say it's the s in sock that everything lives and dies by here which means do you actually know how to make creative for Pinterest versus LinkedIn versus YouTube shorts versus Tick Tock and that is creative strategy and platform strategy and understanding attention and culture at a PhD level and yet most people just mail in their social and they care about all this other stuff their brand and billboards and Remnant TV and I'm just watching this landscape and so a to drive down cost there are plenty of 22 to 30 year olds you can hire that will give you a better cost basis that are very capable of producing the content but you need somebody at the top that understands the s in sock Like A Champion or the whole thing's a waste or B I believe we're 24 months away because I'm in this business we have gotten so far ahead of everybody in the last 24 months in Fortune 500 land that there are now copycat agencies or the big companies are starting to take the creative seriously and are looking to drive down costs get away from 300 000 videos for television and getting into two hundred thousand dollars a month of creative but making 650 pieces of creative that are meaningful for brand and sales and so I'm starting to see the market go there so finding someone who does it for real for real like for a lot of mid-tier Brands piggyback Brands really spending forty to fifty thousand dollars a month on Creative that really builds brand to many different consumer segmentations but also shows organic virality which then become your performance ads is where a lot of brands are going to go whereas they're mailing in that fee right now and they'd rather spend it on media dollars but their CAC numbers are going through the roof because iOS 14.5 came along and changed the game and there's just a lot going on in the Tactical operational side by the way influencers really focusing on micro influencers because you get content and distribution uh being smarter about your partnership deals like if you're going to do a partnership get at all costs getting content out of the system and not having creatives that think about ideas but having creatives that think and make I'll give you a great comp people always like Gary but how do I know Tick Tock will be here in five years I'm like well when you bought trillion dollar commercials on Seinfeld you weren't trying to guess when they were going to end the show right you didn't like you didn't need NBC to promise you that friends would play Forever you just bought ads on Friends when the attention was on Friends so for me I'm on emotional I don't give a [Â __Â ] about Tick Tock Facebook YouTube Instagram could care less if they all disappeared off the face of the Earth I'd be pumped because all that attention would have to go somewhere and I think most people would struggle to figure out where and that's my favorite thing to do right so I would say a couple things number one it's more about like knowing if something resonates is the most common sense thing in the world if you're a DTC brand you can literally see it if you're asking for call to actions and if you're doing it for Branding the qualitative comments show you one of the reasons I'm obsessed with social creative is not only does it build brand and give me a framework to be able to build relevance at scale it's also the single greatest consumer insights machine of all time but back to the essence sock 25 of the creative that I personally in my brand and what Vayner does that I put out is strictly made to get insights of curiosity of hypotheses I have about the consumer literally it is made to get the comments so that I can build on the hypothesis to create affirmation to create better content and so it's the most common sense thing on earth to know if it's working you see it in the comments and you see it in the sales if you choose to make it more of a sales DNA it's a hell of a lot easier to know if your social creative is resonating than if you're television or sponsorship is resonating when we did television broad everybody saw our [Â __Â ] vanilla when you do relevance at scale in this environment fewer people cross over and seeing the different contexts it was the reverse everybody saw your Heineken ad and if it didn't resonate to them which oh by the way it didn't to 90 because everything is vanilla when it's in a 30 second video because it has to be because it has to do everything for everybody in such a short period of time so ironically we're in a let we're in a place now where we can everybody always goes to fear oh schizophrenia I go to we used to sell vanilla and hope that 10 gave a [Â __Â ] now we can sell on relevance and have a lot more people care about our Brands what has happened in business is everyone has gotten so infatuated with scale and efficiencies that we don't amortize out the actual value so for me and it's so funny that John just joined I don't know if you guys see him on screen or if I'm only here but if you see do you guys see him so jamo like held he heads up all of Boehner's philosophy on media investment and so we talk about day trading attention and all things we talk about all the time but if you ask jamo and I what is our favorite thing that we're working on kind of in our secret lab because we're the weird ones is a scalable human infrastructure that has 17 employees that work all day to be able to reach out to every single person on social and be able to price them out and if they are a good buy at 850 to do a influencer ad then it's a good buy if they're four thousand bucks and they charge 8.50 and it costs us 27 an hour to execute we're in but nobody wants overhead on unscalable right and so like scaling the humans is the most interesting thing for me right now and so when we talk about it's the biggest thing one of the reasons I'm ultra confident about building be friends is I'm right now building that infrastructure so that people are every YouTube family on Earth is opening up the toys and the trading cards every cool person is wearing the hoodies and the t-shirts at massive scale to me everyone became infatuated with working media and became one dimensional CAC in LTB monsters and are overpaying for awareness and I'm looking to win on depth and scaling the unscalable and so influencers at scale are really interesting because nobody everyone's focused on Gross versus net the net result of your cost of getting an influencer that you paid four thousand dollars for that is worth twenty six thousand is remarkable because you get the content and the media distribution but you also get the word of mouth and the cosine and the endorsement and the long tail affinity foreign [Music]

Leap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NwXzqE8CUk,are you having problems with brand recognition do you need help getting seen in social media hi it's leanne cohen here digital success catalyst and owner of marketing leap and today i'm going to be talking about how to build a brand in social media to actually increase the value and the clientele in your business [Music] want to learn more about branding and social media marketing want to lose the marketing overwhelm in your business and figure out clear steps to grow your business in the digital space and make sure that you click the button below and subscribe and let's have a chat today about social media growth and branding your business i guess one of the first questions is why is a brand so important well branding is basically a marketing term or a marketing practice in which you create a name a logo a visual representation of what it is that your business actually stands for and it is actually almost like a all about who you are as a business and how you want to be perceived perception is a big thing when it comes to marketing because it really is all about how your clients see you so one of my favorite quotes is a quote by jeff bezos who actually says that your brand is what other people say when you're not in the room so your brand name can actually be created to give a perception or feeling of loyalty of trust of being a premium brand or on the flip side being a mass market depending on how you show up how you put yourself out there how you're advertised and how you promote yourself on social media one of my favorite sayings is that your brand is your client's sum total of their emotional attachment and experience with you and your business so the first question that you really need to ask yourself when you are showing up and showing up online when you're doing videos or lives like this or even just when you're putting out content is what perception does your clients actually have about the service that you currently offer knowing how to brand your business or yourself means you need to firstly create a compelling message that makes you not only stand out online but actually calls your ideal clients in because there's nothing worse than desperation and people know when you're actually chasing life gets so much easier when you have your brand set up in such a way that your ideal client can actually see you online and look at what you do and go oh my god i need to work with them so one of the first things when it comes to actually showing up online and and actually getting that brand recognition for your business is to actually define your business so you've got to pick the best symbols or the best factors that actually resonate with your brand it comes up to you know it's not just naming but it's it's making sure that you are very very clear on the services that you offer your core values and and these are the most important things knowing what your company's core values are making sure that you have even if you are a sole trader a mission statement and a vision statement so that you know where you want to go you know what you want to achieve you know what the outcomes are that you are actually giving your ideal client so once you've actually got that mapped out and you've defined your business because you are so clear on the outcomes and what you offer your ideal client it makes it so much easier to convey that message to them and of course it gets into making sure that you've got the right calls to action and again it's all about portraying yourself out then putting yourself out there so that you are actually calling in your ideal client the second thing that you need to be really really clear on is who your ideal target is now there are so many mediums out there now especially now that you know facebook and and google are fighting with governments and everything else there are so many different platforms and as a business owner and especially as a small business owner you really can't afford to be on every single one so what you need to do is actually define who your target market is now often what i tell my clients is have a look at your client base that you have currently and pick that one client who loves what you do pays you on time because if they don't pay you on time you don't have a business you've got a hobby they tell everybody about you and you love working with them so there are the core things to you that you look at and and again when you look at them you can actually say if i had 10 of them or 100 of them my business would be set so that's who your target market is that's who you're talking to from there when it comes to your messaging making sure that you know exactly what it is that they need it's all well and good being really great at something but if you're not fulfilling a need for your target market you're not going to have a business so making sure that when you do put yourself out there you are fixing a need that they have you're making their life easier in some way that is the fastest way to to actually get your brand out there so knowing who your target market is so important because it dictates how you show up it dictates what language you use and it also dictates what platforms you show up on so if you're business to business you can do as many facebook lives as you like but if your ideal client isn't on facebook you're wasting your time again knowing who your target market is is so important because that is going to be the basis of everything that you do when you show up and then the third thing is to be consistent and as i'm constantly saying and this is not my statistics these are this is a google statistic your ideal client needs to see and hear you 22 times now before they start recognizing who you are we are constantly being bombarded with marketing messages regardless of where we're at even on our phones these days we're getting reminders notifications everything is constantly coming at us so your ideal client needs to see and hear you 22 times so if you are not being consistent and it doesn't mean that you have to show up all day every day it just means that you have to almost train your audience and your clients to know that okay on these particular days you're going to show up and you are going to drop some information or give them some tips on how their life is going to be easier so not only showing up if you are doing video on the same day and the same time but then making sure that you have consistency across every single digital touch point and i've lost track of the amount of times that i've started working with a client who will have one particular profile cover image on one platform which will be completely different to what they have on their website which is completely different again to what they have on another platform and then they wonder why people don't recognize them so one of the things that you'll notice is that nine times out of ten when i show up online i'm wearing red because red's my branding color and it's just that consistency the minute you start becoming consistent and recognizable to your ideal clients the more they're going to start taking notice of you being consistent in the imagery that you use a classic case in point i have a client who is a coder now at one stage they wanted to start using sketch images and almost comic looking images on their site and on their posts which really didn't resonate with the industry it didn't resonate with their brand making sure that the imagery that you use the colors that you use are consistent is so important and generally what we do is we say to our clients no more than three fonts no more than three colors and you use those consistently across everything that you do and again even with your showing up you've got to make sure that you are showing up regularly and consistently and then final tip is to build a strong online presence so start by actually building those social media pages and getting content out there and showing up regularly be the expert share your story and and be genuine and connect in how you can actually help people and how you can make their lives easier so yeah the first thing is to find your business know your target market and third be consistent if you're not too sure exactly how to start working out what your branding should be or if you're on the right track there's three questions that you can also ask does my brand easily show my clients how i help them when i talk about what i do does my message draw clients in and does my brain stand out and create a connection with my clients if it doesn't then we need to go back to the drawing board have a look at why you're here have a look at what your mission is have a look at what it is what is the pain point that you solve for your clients and then work forward from there so if you'd actually like to learn more about branding and social media marketing and if you'd really like to lose the overwhelm in your business and actually define some really clear steps on how to grow your business in the digital space please connect with me we do have a series of online courses rolling out we also have the digital success academy which is a 12 month program which will actually just help you get on the right path and actually grow your business rather than flailing around in the dark so thank you so much for spending the time with me today i hope that has been of some value to you i will see you

KWrzzHlPQ7Y,How to create a content strategy for ANY brand,Unknown,183982,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KWrzzHlPQ7Y/hq720.jpg,2022-04-08 00:00:00,919,THE FREELANCE FRIDAY PODCAST,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWrzzHlPQ7Y,"Hey, hey, welcome back to the
Freelance Friday Podcast. Today I want to talk to you about how
to build a content strategy for any brand, whether you're looking
to build up your own personal or freelance brand or you're consulting
with a client who needs some help. Here is my formula. The first thing that you'll want
to think about is content pillars. So to put it as simply as I know how
a content pillar is basically just like a category or a bucket of content
that, um, supports your overall brand and your overall message and strategy,
I recommend having no more than two to three key content pillars or. Themes. Otherwise you kind of
start to confuse people. I've recommended the book, building
a StoryBrand by Donald Miller, many times that he says in that book,
this quote that I just love, he says, when you confuse, you lose. And I am always reminding myself of that. When I am writing a landing page or
siting on content pillars for my brand or somebody else's brand, you really want
to make it straightforward and obvious. What you do, and you know what you are
the sort of expert or what you want to be known for thing of content pillars. Like, you know, if I say your
name or your business name, what words do you want to follow that? What do you want me to
associate with your brand? For me, that might be
social media marketing. That might be content creation
that might be freelancing, right? Those are kind of my key areas of focus. And truthfully, it should probably
be niched in even further than that. Definitely a multi-passionate person. So I like to talk about a lot of different
things, but yeah, keeping it to two to three is going to make sure that your
audience knows what you're talking about. And my, my big tip on this too, is to make
sure that you can tie your pillars back to actual services or offers that you have,
you don't want to waste your time, you know, talking about, I don't know, like. Make SEO a huge part of my brand
because I do think SEO is important, but I don't have an SEO course. I definitely don't do SEO as a service. And, um, that's not something that
I personally can make money from. So while I might throw in an SEO video
here or there, if I feel like it's really going to benefit you, or I might
bring in an expert, you know, interview an expert for the podcast who does
know SEO, it's not going to be the overwhelming majority of my brand because
I, I can't make money from it because. You know, if you're monetizing your
ads and things like that, but now we're getting in the weeds with it. Once you decide on what your overall
themes or content pillars are going to be, of course, you're going to want to
decide on individual topic ideas, but before you can do that, you need to decide
where are you going to be putting this content by way of distribution checks? So if I have my way, if I had made
choice, I would say that you should focus on one long form content distribution
channel, meaning a YouTube or a blog. There may be other ones, but
those are the key ones that I think people usually focus on. And then, you know, a
couple, at least one though. Short form content distribution channel,
meaning a Tik TOK and Instagram, a Facebook, a Twitter, no focusing
on your long form content piece. First is going to make things
so much easier for you. And I know that a lot of you
are so tired of me saying this, but it really is true at least. Definitely been how I have found success
is focusing on that bigger, long form, more well thought out, more detailed
and carefully planned content piece that really drives the rest of my strategy. I can easily cut up these YouTube videos
and podcasts into Instagram reels and tech talks and Instagram posts and
tweets and blog posts and all that stuff. By starting with that big long form piece. First, the long form content is also
going to help drive SEO strategy. You know, if I. Do SEO research for my YouTube
videos, then I kind of already know that those topics are optimized
for other platforms somewhat. Now of course, I have to do
platform specific hashtag research and things like that as well. But I know that I have a pretty
good grip, at least with Google, considering YouTube is owned by Google. As far as coming up with
my YouTube content ideas. I like to use websites like answer
the public is an interesting. Start with, you know, if one of my
pillars is social media marketing, I can pop that into answer the public and
then look at some of the topics that are suggested that people are searching for. And then you can sort of, you know,
take your pick and say, are any of these relevant, or can I put my unique,
interesting spin on any of those things? It also use a tool for
YouTube called too buddy. I'll leave a link in the show notes, and I
really make sure that I can optimize that. Let's just say, answer the public
gives me social media marketing for. Something like that. I'm going to then put that into YouTube
and to buddy, and really wordsmith that to come up with the most SEO
optimized title specifically for YouTube. Now, I also like to get content ideas just
from like being a person on the internet. I'm always lurking on sites like Cora
and Reddit and Twitter, of course. And just seeing what kind of the discourse
is, if I'm noticing that, you know, what social media management portfolio. People are really talking about
this on Twitter this week. Maybe I need to post this week's podcast
about social media management portfolios to kind of hop in on this trend while
it's still sort of being discussed. So that's sort of how I break up the
topics based on the content pillars. And then I break those up even further
into those short form distribution channels by using a tool called descript. I just like easily cut up my
different long form content. Sometimes I record original things
too, of course, but starting with that base of the long form content
is really what works best for me. And by the way, I am working
on finalizing details. I know I told you, I think in the last
podcast that I'm working on a video sort of challenge, accountability
group, Spring summer and finalizing the details for it right now. So if you are thinking that YouTube might
be your long form distribution channel, if you want to pop your email into the link
in the show notes and description box, this is not making you pay for anything. It's just a hand raiser. If you think you might be interested,
I'll be sure to let you know before everyone else, when doors are open. I think it's going to be really fun
to get us encouraged to actually do the thing, because I know
that that's the hardest part is. You know, starting I've been there. Believe me, last thing, real
quick and distribution channels. If you're wondering, where do I go? There are so many of them out there. I hear you. I struggle with this sometimes as
well, but this really comes down to knowing your audience, who are you
trying to talk to and what are you trying to get them to do as well? That's also important. You know, most people are using social
media to hopefully help them generate leads, which will lead to sales. Um, but maybe you have a different idea. Maybe it's customer service, in
which case I'm going to tell you. Focused on Twitter or Facebook. Those are good places to have dialogue
with customers, things like that. But overall, you're going to want to
make sure you know who your customer is. If you're going to tell me that you
are focusing on a very young gen Z audience, then of course, I'm probably
going to tell you, you need to be on Tik TOK, but if you're focusing on like,
you know, I don't know moms in there. Thirties and forties, Facebook,
particularly Facebook groups might still be a very valuable place for
you to be if you're focusing on the younger millennials who are a little
bit trendy and into fashion and style and things like that, Instagram
is probably where you want to be. So look up these different platform,
demographics, learn what the. Key audiences on each of these
different platforms, you can just Google, I'll try to find some links
and put them in the show notes for you as well that I like to reference,
but you know, have an understanding of what each platform is for LinkedIn. Of course, if you're trying to reach
professionals and you're doing B2B content, LinkedIn is the obvious choice,
but you might also want to be on Twitter. So, um, research the platforms and that's
going to help you determine which of these shorter form and long form distribution
channels you should be focusing on. Now, one of the Hills that I have been
kind of dying on lately, I don't know if you can continuously die on a hill,
but if you can, one of the Hills that I have been dying on lately is, you know,
really getting people to understand the difference between strategy and
tactics strategy is what we just kind of talked about, you know, knowing
your audience, researching to determine which platforms you should be on. Do we. Content research, developing
your messaging and your pillars, that strategic work. Now, when we get down to this part
of the day-to-day or the week to week content, calendar, building and
deciding, are we going to post a reel today, or are we going to post a Tik TOK
or are we going to post a story today or are we going to post a carousel? Those are tactics. Those are things that change a little bit. Frequently. And that may be impacted by a
number of things like the algorithm, you know, like new features being
rolled out like trends, right? So that is going to be the stuff that's
going to be a little bit more flexible. And you're kind of going to need to
go week by week, day by day, month by month, et cetera, versus this is our
strategy for the year or for the quarter. So the last piece is that you're going
to need to decide on those tactics. You're going to build
out the content calendar. You're going to take a
look at what's trending. You're going to decide what you have
the resources and the bandwidth to do. Some of your clients, may it love
to be on video and they just want to record tech talks all day long. In which case I'm kind of jealous of
you because those are rare unicorns. Others are not going to be into that
and you need to get creative and you need to maybe work with the designer
to create some carousels or some static posts and things like that. So, Content formats are really
going to focus on and start communicating your message that way. And going back to content pillars
really quick, why they're so important and so helpful to have is when I'm
building up my content calendar, whether it is digital or whether it's
on paper, I'm just writing a list. Whatever I like to use. Highlights using a particular
color or use an emoji or whatever, to identify each of the pillars. And that way it can see, okay, we've
got a good mix going here of our one or two or three pillars, and
it's not like all focused on one. And then I'm like throwing in, you
know, video or whatever at the very end. And it's coming out of left field. So people do really start
to align you with the. Key things that you do
want to be known for. I am going to try to not make today's
question of the day into a long rant, but I'm warning you and it might happen. The question is, is real,
is the only way to grow. And if someone is not comfortable with the
reels, then what should the next step be? So again, reels are really a tactic. They are a feature, uh, they're
not like the whole strategy. So do keep that in mind and my answer to. Is no, I don't think that you do need
to create reels to grow on Instagram. For those who don't know, reels
are very similar to a tick talk. There are a short form,
vertical video content type. And no, I don't think that
you have to be posting reels every day to grow on Instagram. I personally don't post
reels very often at all. I pretty much have my same content
strategy on Instagram from like 2020 now. Is growth as fast as it was in 2020. I don't think so. I think it's slowed a little bit because
the algorithm is favoring reels and just a lot of other reasons I usage maybe
down, I don't know, there's a lot of, a lot of things that may be going on, but
I still am growing and I still am getting what I personally need out of Instagram. That's why it's also so
important to know your goals. Because one of my goals, one of
my big goals for Instagram is to have a, you know, a communication. Hub between myself and my audience. So I get tagged in things
I'm able to respond. I'm able to respond to direct messages
and practically send direct messages so that like, it's really serving
me whether I create reels or not. Now I do create them
every once in a while. They're largely repurposed from TechTalk
and Tech-Talk is largely repurposed or, you know, Fired by what I post on YouTube. So you see how it kind
of all works together. I'm I don't remember the last time I
created an original Instagram real, to be honest with you now, of course,
that is just, you know, one story and I have no doubt that a lot of people
are absolutely crushing it by using reels, but you also don't want to force
something if you absolutely hate it, or you don't have the bandwidth for it,
or your audience is not liking it, you know, everything really is so subjective. It's hard to give a blanket strategy. For everybody that just doesn't exist. If it was that easy to do it, there
would be no need for social media managers or no need for strategist or,
you know, a YouTube channel like mine. Right. Because it would just be
plug and play copy and paste, but that's not how it works. So test things, figure out
if they do work for you. If, uh, like this person
asked, what should I do? My client is not comfortable with reels. Well, the first thing I'm going to
encourage you to do is still test them. If you can. I actually created a video. I'll link it in the show notes about how
to create reels without using your face. So maybe you can try something like that. Try some screen shares or. Test out some, you know, stock
videos and quotes and things like that to see if they do work, you
know, I think it's worth testing. And then another thing that
you can do is repurpose. So if they are on video anywhere
else, or even just on audio, cause you can get creative by
using images and things like that. Using a tool like descript repurpose,
you know, just take clips of that content and use it on reels. This is something that
I'm doing with tech talk. And then in turn with the
reels is like, no, I don't. The best strategy to make me go
viral is just like taking clips on my podcast, but it is content I'm creating
and we really need to maximize it. So at the very least, I'm going
to repurpose some of this hard work that I'm putting into this
channel onto those other channels. So I at least have a presence. So if somebody does search for
me on Tik TOK, they can find me, they can see that I'm there. Um, and they can get to some of my other
content from there at the very least. So what I'm going to say. Just to reiterate and clarify
that I would start testing. If you can do some faceless reels, do
whatever you can to at least test it and then repurpose test them, measure
them, like actually write down numbers. This is important to the
scientific process, right? It's to actually be able to analyze
your data and see what does perform. If you see that the reels are just
off the charts, you're just going to need to have a tough conversation
with your client and let them know that these reels are performing
better than anything else we're doing. So you might have to suck it up
and get on camera, or maybe we hire somebody to be on camera or maybe it's
you, you want to come up with a plan that's the long and the short of it. All right. Let me know in the comments, I would
really love to know which distribution channels you are focusing on right now. Well, for long form and
for short form, if you're. Participating in any type of long
form content yet, let me know. What's holding you back. Uh, no judgment at all. And if you think YouTube might be
one that you are looking to either grow or start to be sure to put your
email into that handraiser list, uh, leave it in the show notes for you. It doesn't obligate you
to purchase anything. I just want to let you all know
before anyone else, when the doors are open for my accountability
group, which I'm really excited. So, thanks so much for tuning in
and spending time with me today. I appreciate it as always. And I hope you have a
beautiful rest of your day. I'll see you in the next one. Bye"
45vj4nsSv_s,How to Create a Social Media Strategy for 2024 Step by Step,Unknown,143302,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/45vj4nsSv_s/hq720.jpg,2023-12-22 00:00:00,1370,THE FREELANCE FRIDAY PODCAST,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45vj4nsSv_s,"Hello, hello, and welcome back to
the freelance Friday podcast today. I want to talk about how to build a
social media strategy in 2024, because some things have definitely changed. In fact, that's kind of the
point they change every single year, different platforms, pop up
different platforms, gain popularity. Things go out of business or out of style. And it's important that we make
sure that we are updating our social media strategies at least every
year, whether it's for a client or for your own small business. So the first thing that you want to keep
in mind when you are putting together a social media strategy is first off,
what is our goal with social media? And again, you want to make sure
that you are updating this year over year, a very new business might have
the primary goal of just gaining a following building awareness because
they're new in the market, right? They might not be focused at
this point on a huge amount of conversions or anything like that. They just might be wanting
people to know who they are. So in those cases, you're going
to be looking at awareness focused metrics like reach, meaning how many
people actually saw your post, like impressions, how many times were your
posts seen, and that's also going to drive your content strategy as well. So if you are really just focused
on awareness, you're going to be looking for those platforms and those
content types that are super viral or have super viral potential, right? Whereas if you were more Mid funnel,
as we say, you know, the top of the funnel is very awareness focused. The middle of the funnel is more about
engagement, actually getting those people who have followed you or have seen your
content to like you to start to trust you and start to move to the bottom of
the funnel to the point of purchase. So if you're in that middle funnel
stage, you might be focusing on platforms that are more about. Brand affinity and engagement. So something like a YouTube or a
podcast, those types of content allow you to kind of sit with the, the person
who's hosting, get to know your brand a little bit better, build up that trust
before they go ahead and, and bite. So this is really important to
think about because like I said, your goals can change over time. Your client's goals can change over time. You're one, you might be focused
on awareness year two, you might be focused more on engagement year three,
you might be focused on conversion. And of course, you know, you can
move through that funnel faster too. That can all happen within the span of
a year or even, you know, a couple of months, but the actions that you take. The tactics that you recommend
are going to be different depending on where they're at. So it's really important to keep that in
mind and really important to keep in mind your KPIs or key performance indicators. Those were those metrics that I was just
talking about, you know, impressions, reach engagement, because if you are
reporting on the wrong thing to your client, if you're saying, Hey client,
we just gained a bunch of followers, but they're really focused on conversions. Or if you say, Hey, we got a bunch of
engagements, but they're really focused on, you know, awareness and how many
people saw their post, you might be speaking the wrong language to them. And it can be a struggle
to retain your clients. And it can be a struggle for
you to, to know how well you're. Um, and then you're going to want to make
sure that you're actually performing. Now, the next thing to think
about is who you're talking to. And obviously you should probably
have this in mind when you're thinking about your goal as well. But step two, I really want you to paint
a detailed picture of who you are trying to reach with your social media content. Yes, most clients, most businesses
are not going to be mad at anybody seeing their posts. However, there are absolutely more likely
customers or the most likely customers. That we can all kind of points you
and knowing your target audience drives so much of this strategy. If I'm speaking to men in their
sixties, I'm going to be on a different platform than if I'm speaking to young
women, you know, ages 20 and under. Right. And I know those are two pretty extreme. Differences, stark differences,
but there can even be subtleties. And are you trying to reach women in
their thirties who are stay at home moms or women in their thirties who
are mid career professionals, right? Those are two different platforms. Those are two different maybe looks and
feels and sounds of your copy of your. Um, and if you're looking for a way to
get more content, you want to look at your images of your content types, right? Not always, there can absolutely be
overlap in those things, but you want to keep those things in mind before you
make any serious decisions about which platforms you're going to be on, what
style you're going to post in, and so on. I get this question a lot. What if my client doesn't
know who they want to reach? And first off, I consider this a
little bit of a, I would say maybe like a pink flag or an orange flag. If your client comes to you and
says, Hey, run my social media, but I have no idea who I want to
reach, or I want to reach everybody. That isn't a great sign
for me necessarily, because any business owner who. Really is about their business
for lack of better words. They will be able to explain this to you. And this is something you can take for
your own business to like, get in the habit of, of talking about your ideal
customer, really knowing who they are. You'll be better for it. You'll be more clear when talking
to others who want to refer you to people or, you know. So, yeah, I take it as a bit of a,
you know, like I said, an orange flag. It doesn't mean that you definitely
shouldn't work with that client. Definitely in startup phase,
early days, they might just be a little all over the place and
still be figuring these things out. I think there are exercises you can do
with them to help them figure it out. We go through a whole buyer
persona lesson in the social media management accelerator. There's some templates that you
can use with your clients to kind of walk them through that process. So that's really helpful, but it's
definitely a conversation that you should be having before you sign a contract
with a client, it should come as no surprise to them or to you that you're
going to need that information to make. Sound social media strategy
decisions for them. And by the way, if you are interested
in joining the next round of the accelerator, I will leave a link
for you down in the show notes where you can join the waitlist. You'll be the first to know when
we open doors for the next round, and that'll get you the absolute
best deal on enrollment fees. As well as some fun bonuses. So be sure to check that out. The accelerator is my immersive
program for social media managers or aspiring social media managers. We go through all of this strategy
stuff, step by step together in a cohort or group environment. It's not just any other course where you
get the material and you walk away with it and are left to your own devices. I am involved. I am there as your coach and you get
to communicate with your peers as well. So it's a good time. And we've been able to help hundreds
getting really close actually to the thousand student Mark, um, of students,
you know, improve their careers, launch their social media management careers. And. Move up to the next level. All right the third step in this
once you know who you're talking to you Know what you want to do. The third step is you want to decide
which platforms you are going to focus on now There are a million platforms out
there It feels like and it can be really challenging to decide which ones you're
gonna be on Or decide how much, you know, are, are you going to be on all of them? It can be very tempting to do that. My recommendation is to choose
at least one longer form or more SEO friendly platform. I'm talking a YouTube. I'm talking Pinterest, which is
a little bit of a, you know, it's not really long form, but it's
definitely very search heavy. Even a podcast or a blog, I know there's
not really social media, but they're going to help you create social media content. So choose one of those platforms if you
can, and then choose one shorter form, more trendy, more potentially viral. Platform like a tech talk, like
Instagram reels, like YouTube shorts. If you're doing long for
YouTube, you should probably be doing YouTube shorts as well. So start there with two
platforms to really focus on. And ideally they're going
to work well together. So for my example, I do YouTube,
that's my primary platform. And then I repurposed to all
of those other platforms. I really started by just
repurposing to tech talk. And then once I realized, okay. I'm learning kind of how to edit
for short form platforms and what's really working over there. Then I started repurposing onto
Instagram reels and, you know, LinkedIn and other things like that. So that's my best tip. Don't overwhelm yourself, especially
if you're a one person team. If you're either running social
media for your own business. or, you know, your solopreneur, solo
freelancer doing social media for a brand don't overwhelm yourself unless
you are already quite experienced. Now, with that said, how,
how did I decide on YouTube? Right. How might you decide between Pinterest
and LinkedIn or TikTok and YouTube shorts? Well, what I really recommend
doing is looking at the data. If you have been around for a
while, you know, that Metro Cool is a sponsor of this podcast. It is my favorite social media tool. They have scheduling, they have analytics. They have so much. You can always use my code Latasha at the
link down in the description to get 30 days free on any of their premium plans. But I've actually got something
a little bit more exciting even to talk to you about today. They're 2023 social media networks study. It is here and it is glorious. They analyzed over 20 million
social media posts from nine different social media platforms. It's their biggest study yet, and
it's packed with valuable insights and trend predictions for 2024. You can get answers to questions like how
has it evolved social media since 2023? What are the top performing
content formats these days? Which platforms and strategies
are working best for brands and businesses and so much more. So again, you can check that
out down in the show notes. I'll leave a direct link to that study. It's totally free to check out. There is so much good data in there. And if you want to try out
Metro cool, use code Latasha. 30 days free on any of
their premium plans. I'll leave that link down below as well. So yeah, look at the data, look
at reports like this one from Metricool, but also look at your
own data or your client's own data. So go through their past performance and. Take a look and really break things down. For me, this was not just looking
at my on platform, social media data, which can be helpful. You know, if you go into Instagram
insights, for example, or Facebook insights, or if you hook your social
media up to a tool like metrical, you can get some reports that you can scan
through, but I like to even take it a step further than that and look at my Google. Analytics. So if you can get access to your
clients, Google analytics, or you can install it on your own website
and see which social media platforms are referring the most traffic. To the website that is the end goal,
if that is indeed your end goal. So example, if you are doing social media
for an e commerce brand, well, you don't really need to care all of that much about
how many, you know, impressions or how many engagements are getting on Instagram. You want to know how many add to
carts you're getting, or at least how many landing page visits are
getting over on your website, right? So Google analytics will enable you
to be able to see which platforms are, are indeed referring traffic your way. And that'll help you decide where to
pull the lever, where to, you know, invest more time in and so on, and
where not to invest a ton of time. When I look at my Google analytics
report for my course website, at least. I see that YouTube is really
doing double duty for me. It is referring almost all of
my traffic, that and Google. So that's why I'm still doing YouTube. That is why I invest so much time and
energy into YouTube because it, it works for me in terms of referring traffic. Meanwhile, Instagram does
almost nothing for me. And that doesn't mean that
Instagram isn't valuable. Again, we got to go back to
our goals here and think. What do we really want to
do with these platforms? And for me, Instagram is a
customer service channel. It's a communication channel. It's a branding channel for me, whereas
YouTube is more about conversions and that kind of mid to down funnel type
of content, there is a ton of data in that metrical study, but some of the. Um, kind of insights that I found the
most interesting and most relevant to this conversation when we're thinking
about overall strategic planning for next year, number one, that reels are
really essential to growth, either on Facebook and or on Instagram. still are really important
to those strategies. So keep that in mind. If you're planning out social
media content for Instagram or Facebook, you want to make sure
that reels are included in that. Another one that's very interesting
to me is that tick tocks video length is steadily increasing. It seems like tech talk is like. We are ready to, uh, you
know, make advertising money. We're ready to increase
some of that brand affinity. And they are up to an
average of 55 seconds. Now, a lot of us got introduced to
Tik TOK as like a 15 second, sometimes even like seven second video app. Well, they are. Looking to compete, I think with YouTube,
with podcasts, with, with all the things. And the average is up to 55 seconds. YouTube, YouTube uploads are up for
most creators, so we're uploading more often, but engagement is down. So this gave me a little bit of
reassurance that it's not just me, but. Yeah, I still think that
YouTube is incredibly valuable. Maybe we'll have this
conversation at another time. Let me know if you're interested
in it, but yeah, I think it's getting a little bit harder to keep
people's attention on this platform. So that might mean that if you are going
to choose YouTube as a platform that you focus on, that you're also investing in
an editor, that you're also investing in a team who can be on camera and be really
engaging and keep people's attention. You know, Goodbye are the days
of just posting boring corporate webinars on YouTube and really
expecting that to grow your channel to anything significant, right? So this is an investment, both
time, both financial, uh, people investment, all of that, even though
I do think it is incredibly valuable. Twitter or X has had quite, quite a year,
quite, quite a, quite a time lately. Well, it looks like even though there
have been lower posts, the lower post frequency for most brands engagement
is actually up on those posts. So it seems like the people who are
sticking around or like really sticking around, and I think some of, uh, the, you
know, Exodus from the platform, a lot of people, a lot of brands have left Twitter. Over the past year, I think it's made, uh,
Twitter a little bit less overwhelming. So the people that you are
following, you're excited when you see them in their feed. So still could be a very viable strategy. And the last point that I wanted
to share with you is that LinkedIn shares are up significantly this year. I feel like we never talk about LinkedIn,
you know, the proverbial we, as in. Uh, the marketing community, the
social media community, the YouTube community, I feel like LinkedIn is kind
of forgotten about sometimes, but it is an incredibly valuable platform. And people are wanting to
share content over there. So post content for them to share. After you decide on your
platforms, you need to decide what you're actually going to say. How are you actually going to
achieve those goals on those platforms and reach the right people? First, I think we got to
start with messaging, like What is our overall promise? What is our brand promise? What is our offer? What is our unique value proposition? Making sure that you
really figure that out. And again, as a social media
manager, if you're like a freelance social media manager, that's not
necessarily your job to come up with brand boilerplate messaging. But again, just like the audience,
this should be something that you are comfortable communicating about. This should be something that you
are comfortable asking for, sending them through an onboarding form
that asks for this information, having that conversation. If they maybe have a very long, this
is something that I had to do a lot when I worked in corporate is like, we
would have this very long boiler plate kind of Wikipedia style messaging. And I'm like, we got a. Socialize this, we've got to
condense this down for social media. Cause I only have a certain number of
characters to put into my Instagram bio. So while you might not be responsible
for that per se, you are responsible for getting that information and
communicating that information. From there, I like to
create content pillars. So I recommend coming up with two to three
kind of buckets of content or categories of content, whatever you want to call it. And again, go back to your goal. If you want to sell stuff, if you are
doing social for an e commerce company, well, then you want to make sure that
you were showcasing social proof. You can do this through testimonials. You can do this through user
generated content, customer. Driven content, right? That's a great way to kind of
show your product in action, show that people are loving it. You might also create a pillar that's
about ingredients or methodology. If it is not a physical product,
maybe if it's like a education product or something like that, it
might be, Hey, here's what we teach. Here's what's included kind of a
look under the hood, if you will, because people want to sort of try
before they buy, they want to know what's inside before they buy, so
that might be a pillar for you. You might leave a pillar on the calendar
for promotions or just kind of things that are going on in the business. Maybe there's a special event. If you run social media for a coffee
shop, there's an arts event, a local community event that you want to
include in that pillar, or maybe you are doing BOGO lattes one day. So making sure that you have
space for that and that you're just planning and leaving room in
your calendar and planning ahead. So if your clients so that you can
communicate about those promotions or those events or that UGC or
whatever you choose as a pillar. If your goal is more about just
growing followers, building up that awareness, that top of the funnel
type content, well, you really want to lean heavy on the value, right? Education. If you have an online business, you
want to make sure that you are really. Telling, showing, you know,
explaining, kind of doing that, what, why type content. So maybe I am a, I teach a course on
gardening, let's just say, uh, I'm going to be talking about why you need a garden. What a garden is, what you can grow in
a garden, what some of the possibilities are, you know, what some of the recipes
are that I've grown from my garden. And the idea is that that educational
content, that top of the funnel content will gain a following,
help you gain a following. And then you can do some of that, how
type of content, that next level content. And in your paid materials in
your paid courses, or even just in future pieces of content that
people choose to continue to watch. So know where you're at in the funnel,
know what the goal is, know who you're talking to, and know what you want to say. And just break that up into
content pillars and then just cycle through that content. You know, making sure that. You're not doing all educational
content for an entire month or all UGC content for an entire month. You're able to look at those other
pillars that you've identified for yourself and can cycle between those
just to keep content fresh and to make sure that you are kind of hitting all
of your, all of your goals, if you will. After you've done all that, it's
really about creating content or doing whatever you need to get content. There's. There's content creation, there's
content curation, and technically speaking, content creation is not
really a social media manager's job. If you're doing this, if you're watching
this for your own business, then yeah, like you got to get scrappy more than
likely, unless you have a huge budget and can hire out content creation. But if you're a social media manager or
freelance social media manager, or even an in house social media manager, you
know, depending on your job description. Creation might not
technically be in your role. However, I do think it is important
that we know enough to be dangerous. As I like to say that we know how to
use Canva, that we know how to browse stock image sites, or take like a basic
photo at a company event or whatever you need to do so that you have stuff
to at least pull from in the beginning. It also might be a part of your
job to work with other teams. So if they're, if you're working in
corporate, or even if you're working as a freelancer, they have a larger
team with a, you know, maybe creative team, a video team, a photo team,
a graphic design team, you need to communicate to them what you need. Hey, I need a batch of
30 testimonial graphics. You know, we need to plan
a video shoot where we can. Create some B roll video of product
features, that kind of thing. So that's kind of the next stage
is really bringing this whole strategy to life because without
action, it's just a piece of paper. It's just a PDF. It's just a deck that you put together. So that's really the fun part. That's the part that I actually
love is the content creation. So yeah, that is really what goes
into a social media strategy. I hope this was helpful. Again, if you want to
check out metrical study. With all of their findings from 2023, you

the wait list for the social media management accelerator. It'll be back early in 2024. I'm so excited to teach this course
again, and to, uh, be able to help you through some of these. Um, so I'm going to be talking about a
lot of these things that we talked about. And if you have any questions for me, feel

YouTube Tips w/ Sean Cannell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWFB_BCQ7zI,gen Z especially their number one search engine is Tick Tock people are getting paid as regular salary from a brand to create content people don't really realize the power of how many companies are searching Tick Tock for a Creator and it's not always about this person has the biggest following it's about does this person look good on camera does this person have a clean enough brand but we can have them represent our companies so what are the best practices this year for growing your business using Tick Tock I'm super excited because in this episode of the think media podcast Kenya Kelly is back on the show dropping some Advanced tips that I'm certain you haven't heard anywhere else and some new things that you need to know when it comes to getting reach on Tick Tock some of the new features and some cool ways to monetize so Kenya how's it going it's going good I'm Still Loving Tick Tock and it's still my favorite thing to do yeah I love it and it's one of uh of course on our community we talk a lot about YouTube but with YouTube shorts and the chance to do vertical video our Tick Tock official think media has been blowing up just as we've repurposed con yet and so I'm excited to learn all of these details from you in today's episode and so you were sharing speaking here yesterday at Social Media Marketing World on some Advanced strategies for success on Tick Tock we'll go through a couple of them yeah but what's new at Tick Tock first there's a couple new things like you can now download the video without the watermark yeah so it's a brand new feature most accounts don't have it yet but they're updating it but you're able to once you have a video in drafts and you pull it up on your main screen and the upper right hand corner you're going to see a little download button and that means you just hit that and now you've downloaded your video without the watermark no more screen recording no more other apps and directly from Tick Tock yeah that's powerful and of course in some cases creators will use this separate website to pull that yeah yeah but this is kind of like Instagram reels that allows you to build out The Tick Tock essentially yeah and then ease more easily repurpose it elsewhere yes for sure maybe not embed the music yet uh yes exactly before that for sure therefore then you could connect the music yeah definitely on reels or somewhere else and shorts and Facebook reels now yeah so that because if best practice would be on every platform yeah connecting the native popular music correct time you upload it exactly yeah so that's a super cool feature and also this this one blew my mind gen Z especially their number one search engine is Tick Tock oh yes so people think Google AI chat gbt might redo search but in the meantime like all generations but especially younger Generations go to tick tock searching for things yes so Tick Tock SEO is a real thing indexing videos longer captions what's what are some of these new updates yeah so it used to be where you could only have 300 uh characters in your descriptions now it's 2200 but it's not about you creating these very long descriptions but it's more so about you being very intentional about your keywords for example let's just say you're teaching YouTube right but your video is about um creating a YouTube short well what Tick Tock wants you to do now is they want you to be very intentional about your SEO keywords so instead of you just saying YouTube shorts or whatever you would say how to create a video on YouTube shorts and when you do that and then you start writing just a few little keywords in the captions if you do your SEO correctly Tick Tock is now like you're gonna see above your video a little search box and you're not going to search there but you will see how you did a good job with SEO because it will say how to create a YouTube short up top and that lets you know that your video is trending in that particular category when someone goes to search for how to create a YouTube short or if you're saying to yourself how do I make a key lime pie and if you want someone making key lime pies and you're saying it on screen like you're saying like you're literally saying here's how to create a key lime pie and then you have the correct things that SEO in your descriptions your video is going to be the first one they see when they search how to create a key lime pie got it and so especially for maybe like a local service provider yeah they could start thinking about properly doing the metadata around their video so that they could be found in real estate or local region and you how did you noticed your videos are indexing exactly what you said you see that it's tick tock for business or something and then it starts showing up yep so I have one of my videos trending right now is how to use tick tock promote and I have a course in my description how to use tick tock remote and what I've noticed is that on that video I see above the video where Tick Tock has put up there how to use tick tock remote and then when I go to the main search screen and just type in how to use 6. promote I'm one of the top videos that then comes up in the you know in all the viral videos you know it's in our community too we have a course called video ranking Academy and we're just obsessed with the of course uh suggested opportunity of kind of going viral on YouTube but also just the Practical opportunity of search based content yeah and how to is one of the best ways to start videos how to fill in what you teach how to uh compare you know a couple different you know so using how to is a major strategy yeah on YouTube this is now relevant take Totten yeah powerful now a couple other things that you shared about one was Tick Tock live shopping what's that yeah so is in beta form but basically where it's like um it's kind of the Home Shopping Network QVC where a brand that is a product based business they have access to where two things one when they post content let's just say this whole outfit and I want to advertise this Cami or whatever I have on well I am able to put in like my inventory of products in in Tick Tock and then people are able to purchase whatever items I have in my particular video but also you're able to do Tick Tock live streams with your inventory or products there as well and people never have to leave The Tick Tock app to make a purchase and so it's in tick tock's best interest of one how do we keep people on the platform two how do we help businesses make money and if I'm able to buy this shirt without ever leaving Tick Tock it's it's golden for me for tick tock and the person that's making the that's making the sales wow and then another thing you shared about was some opportunities in influencer marketing what's happening there so ugc which is user generated content has exploded in 2022 and then now more so in 2023 where not only us as creators but a brand will come to us and ask us to create 15 second video one or two but now it's become this like hey create 10 videos a month and people are getting paid like this regular salary from a brand to create content and so a lot of times Brands don't want to create content on Tick Tock yet because they don't have an in-house person to create vertical video like to be on face but they're able to hire a Creator and the creator doesn't have to go to work they just have to to create content for this particular brand and they're making thousands of thousands of dollars through creating content but as a business you're able to take this content creator who's already good on camera looks good on camera knows how to edit and create these fun videos for your brand and you're able to take that piece run it as ads put it on Tick Tock and all the different vertical video platforms and they're able to explode that way are you ready to start or grow your YouTube channel do you feel stuck and need help connecting the dots join this free web class where you'll learn the step-by-step playbook for YouTube success we've helped thousands of purpose-driven entrepreneurs just like you grow their influence with video register today for this exclusive training at thinkmasterclass.com so this is a big opportunity so to break this down for our community user generated content is content that maybe is being made anyways people are talking about your brand if you have some kind of a product and especially for those maybe you are in e-commerce or thinking about launching a product besides thinking you have to build your own influence what you're saying is that because you know how to create content because you learn how to create vertical videos brands that have products are now looking to get content creators to make them UPC to make them product tutorials yep and then they're paying them and they may be posting those on their own account correct but then they also would go on the brands account yes so we have a lot we actually have an interesting number of of kind of tool channels people that do like DeWalt tools and all kinds of different tools and so it may be something like that like maybe even DeWalt as big of a company as they are they don't have a face or somebody correct but they have people that are working for them so how are these deals coming about how if somebody was like man I would love the opportunity I know I can make videos I can be creative and I can be fun and my own platforms are not very big yet how are they getting in touch with these Brands to make ugc for them in a paid fashion yeah so the number one way is by creating content on Tick Tock people don't really realize the power of how many companies are sir urging take Toc for a Creator they don't really it's like it's thousands and thousands of people every day looking for creators on the platform and mostly it's not necessarily Nike it's the agency that does marketing for uh for Nike so they have this person who they are searching looking for a man or a woman or whatever or uh whatever they're looking for and it's this Creator who they're they're seeing the and it's not always about this person has the biggest following it's about does this person look good on camera does this person have a clean enough brand but we can have them represent our company so first creating content on Tick Tock but the second most powerful way is having your profile in these influencer marketing agencies database so there's thousands of companies that do influence of marketing and me on a regular basis I do couple things one I'm always on Google typing in influencer marketing agencies and if a new one pops up I go to their website I click on influencer and I just set up a set up a profile where it's me it's my account it's what I do yada yada yada and then it's in there and what ends up happening is that this agency then has this company that wants to work with them and they are looking for a person like me and they're able to do a like a filter search in their database they find me and then they contact me so like it's work of like finding all these agencies and putting up your profile but I've made almost 150 000 doing it that way just having my profile set up wow that's powerful strategy and uh next up is people ask the question what type of content should I create on Tick Tock and what are some of the opportunities there so I say three things one is micro learning and it's basically where micro learning is giving people one piece of advice or a tip or what have you versus everything like I'm a business coach and so I could talk about that for hours and hours and hours but people don't have hours to spend to listen to me so I just take one topic and I talk about it for about 45 seconds that's called micro learning where people are able to take one thing learn one thing and say wow that was really good I can apply that to ABC whatever and then now they want to watch the next thing and the next thing tank the second thing is I call it what I say a product teasers and I had this you know a scenario about what's happening with Chipotle and basically um this is where like you have this particular product and you're not necessarily saying they're not necessarily saying go and buy this thing you're just showcasing it so like this one brand I have a skin care and they're always showing these girls just showing their skincare routine they never say go buy this that's this but now you want this strawberry thing that's going to make my skin look like x y z but like with Chipotle they had there's a Creator name is Keith Lee everybody on Tick Tock loves Keith Lee and Keith um is a food reviewer he's just in Vegas he just removes reviews food and what happened was like somebody on Tick Tock was talking about how they go to Chipotle they get a quesadilla but they put steak in it and they put fajitas in it and Keith always goes places comes on and says imma try it and I'm gonna rate it one through ten he always does that and so he's on screen and he is trying this quesadilla we don't know how good it is and we know when it's good because Keith does this like like a past three and he and he just keeps eating and he tells everybody to go to Chipotle and get this thing so it explodes for Chipotle they're like what is going on and so they contact Keith Lee and the girl he learned about it from and then there is a product teaser video with him and his car with the girl and they're saying hey Chipotle is changing their menu it's coming in March they don't say go buy it and just say it's coming so millions of people when that thing lost on the app went to Chipotle and chipotle didn't have a commercial about it it was Tick Tock wow that's powerful it speaks to the influence and speaks to taking something you're passionate about and being creative and trying food and what it can lead to if you punch fear in the face and get out there and start creating content and so um that is amazing as we land the plane if someone's thinking they see what you're doing they look around there's a lot of people crushing it and and one nugget that's interesting that's kind of happening in this moment is we're talking we just talked about this off camera we're here at Social Media Marketing world and and I've been many people that have been coming on the show have just gotten started since 2020. of course that was the pandemic and it reminds me of a study from Adobe that's had 165 million people joined the crater economy since 2020. it was such a disruptive event people were locked down some people just started making content but what was why I'll do was see the maturity of it now in 2023 that we're talking about people who you know quit their corporate job and went full time in 10 months but I know that sometimes that could be discouraging because someone's like well I've been going two years and I still well there's different different paces and different niches and different topics and nevertheless it's been shocking how many people I've met here that have just got in the game not 10 years ago not five years ago but literally just in the last few years so it's not too late to start but I'm curious for you you coach so many different people that I I'm sure they have all kinds of imposter syndrome negative self-talk it's really easy to talk yourself out of pressing record yeah is it even worth starting and so what advice would you give somebody that's starting this year so the first thing I would ask tell a person is to ask yourself why why do you have fear around it right because no matter what we say you're still going to get on camera until you know why you have fear around it uh but once you know you identify what that is then what you also want to ask yourself is what is what would be your goal like is it because you want to just you want to quit your job it's because you really want to be an influencer or you really want to start this business and then once you kind of know like what the fear is and what you want to do then I would advise you to then like I always tell my clients just start recording content and don't hit post initially just get comfortable like just standing there with this phone in your face do a vertical video of just recording and then just doing it and doing it and doing it then I always tell a person to send it to a trusted friend who loves you who can give you feedback who can also encourage you but then also just like it's kind of like fomo take a look at somebody who you saw when they first got started and like here's where you are right now and like then tell yourself what if I would have started back then okay there was that but what if I start right now what could happen for me if I like go I'm just gonna hit a post on this and I'm gonna keep doing this even though I feel fear even though how like how I look or sound on camera but I'm looking at look at them and I can do it too you know it's gonna take a lot of Courage you're gonna feel cringy you're gonna do all the like things about yourself but every single person that first started never said that they were awesome I'm great on camera no one felt that way yeah that's such great advice and uh thank you so much for sharing your wisdom today can you if people want to connect with you wear you out shout out your stuff and what are you working on right now yeah so I am on Kia kelly.com I'm King Kelly on Tick Tock and Instagram the number one thing we are focused on right now is managing accounts on Tick Tock so like for three years people have asked us to manage their accounts and so now we're not offering that service and you can find all that on kenkelly.com awesome we'll link it up in the show notes thanks for being a part of this episode of the think media podcast
iiDYFRQpHE0,Best Instagram Marketing Strategy For Small Business 2024 (PROVEN & PROFITABLE),Unknown,215104,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiDYFRQpHE0/hq720.jpg,2023-12-04 00:00:00,623,Adam Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiDYFRQpHE0,Instagram has changed and there are three things you need to know if you want to get better results and create more effective higher converting and more profitable social media marketing campaigns for you your business or any business that you want to apply this to First is a three-part process I call confirm connect convert that not only works on Instagram but applies equally well to any other social media Network you decide to apply this to but don't worry if you've never heard of this before most haven't so I'll show you exactly what it means and how to use it to get more leads customers and sales than ever before next you need to understand and work with the two biggest factors to Instagram success the audience and the algorithms ignore this or get it wrong and it just doesn't matter how smart or funny or creative your Instagram content is it's just not going to work and lastly is something called attention Arbitrage that Instagram as well as every single other social media platform Out There lives and dies by so with that said let me show you how it's done starting with the all important confirm connect convert first things first I want you to think of your Instagram account as less of a social media profile and more of like a mini website for your business one that's designed to do three very specific things in a very specific order first you need to confirm that visitors to your bio viewers of your content engagers of your feed that sounds like an old fantasy movie anyway you want to make sure that they know they're in the right place and they're crystal clear on exactly what you do and who you do it for this is why you need to make sure that your bio is optimized for conversions by being again crystal clear on what you do and why you're worth following make sure your name and title are clear and easy to understand and use links to guide people on where they should go next make sure to use a highquality image for your profile picture and if you're going to have multiple links in your bio then make sure that the most important one is perched right there at the top next you want to connect which you're going to do in two ways the first is by strategically posting your content at the best possible times which according to this report is Mondays from 10:00 a.m. to noon Tuesdays from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Wednesdays from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and Friday from 9: to 11:00 a.m. the best days to post appear to be Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the worst day to post looks like Sunday also an important note here they don't say it but it's safe to assume that these times are meant for the local time of your target audience so if you're in London and your target audience is in London then post say Monday from 10:00 a.m. to noon London time but if you're in London but your target market is say in Vancouver then post on Monday from 10:00 a.m. to noon Vancouver time most important of all though is that these times are really just guidelines so the best thing you can do is log into your Instagram analytics to find the dates and times that your audience is most active and then post then so that's the first part of connect the second part is using Instagram to actually chat with people I know talking to people crazy idea right I heard it said years ago that conversations are the new leads and if it was true back then well it's even more true today where authenticity and engagement and having genuine conversations with people really is the gateway to building a bigger and better business now if you can respond to each comment manually and go for it on the other hand if your Instagram inbox is more of the overflowing variety than using an automation software solution can be a lifesaver but more on this in just a second because lastly once you've confirmed and connected well you now have the opportunity to move on to the convert stage which just so happens to lead me to this video sponsor Min chat if you're exploring new strategies to boost your Instagram engagement reach and conversions then you definitely want to check out minap an Instagram DM automation tool that's transforming how brand and creators interact on the platform minich chat is also an official meta business partner and approved for Instagram use which makes it a must-have tool for Effective engagement unlike the outdated and far less effective linkoln bio method mini chat gives you the power to engage users directly through comments or DMS sending them information automatically this approach not only increases engagement but also exposes your content to a broader audience plus it shifts sales conversations to the DMS where they have a higher likelihood of converting and allow for personalized interaction and follow-up questions something that's basically impossible with traditional Biol links ultimately what many chat does is turn every Instagram post story real or live into a dynamic conversation starter and making the switch from Biol links to DMS can increase your click-through rate from a mere 1% to a very impressive 46% with every comment becoming a potential conversation and every conversation turning into a potential sale so make sure to check out the link down in the descriptions below this video to start leveraging many chat to supercharge your sales and interactions on Instagram you can use it for free for up to a th000 contacts and the pro version starts at just $15 a month so with that said let's move on to the next Point audience and algorithms here's the deal winning on social media all comes down to just two simple things the audience and the algorithms and in both cases the key to getting more reach more engagement and more followers really just comes down to giving them exactly what they want and the real good news here is that they both want pretty much exactly the same things your audience wants content that's interesting entertaining educational or valuable and the algorithms want you to create content that's interesting entertaining educational or valuable because these are the kind of things that are going to keep your audience engaged and on the platform for as long as possible which is going to allow Instagram to make a whole lot more money so how do you do this good question Adam I'm glad you asked the secret to creating content that both your audience and the algorithms absolutely love comes down to combining two different ingredients or elements pieces little Lego blocks stacked together part one is the message and the actual content itself and part two is the way that the content and message are packaged and presented to the audience when published to social media now I've got some pretty cool stuff to share with you when it comes to part one and how to create truly viral worthy content that gets engagement and followers and shares every time you post but first we actually need to talk about part two which is how you're going to wrap all this up and get it out there so people actually see it after all it doesn't matter how great your message actually is if nobody ever sees it and right now there's a specific format that's working best across most if not all different social media platforms and that is short form vertical video Instagram and Facebook well they call these reals YouTube calls them shorts LinkedIn has native video which doesn't have to be short or vertical so nobody really knows what's going on there and Tik Tok just calls them videos or Tik toks but whatever you call them isn't important here what is important is the question of how you can create short form content that captures the hearts and minds and eyeballs and wallets of your ideal target market so let me walk you through that next when I first started marketing well over 10 years ago now blogging and having an SEO or search engine optimized blog was the key to success this is because Google was the primary traffic driver for most businesses out there and having a high ranking website or a Blog was a virtual guaranteed payday and I remember taking countless courses on blogging and keyword research and writing content marketing and WordPress hosting basically anything and everything that went into running a successful blog and it worked amazing until it didn't you see what happened was that social media platforms took over as the primary traffic driver for many businesses and started coming on the scene and changing consumer behavior and content preferences which meant I needed to Pivot and if Instagram isn't a key part of your social media strategy or you're not really attacking it with a kind of all Hands-On deck mentality then you probably need to Pivot too and this leads me perfectly to the topic of attention Arbitrage which is all about identifying the platforms channels and media opport unities that are offering a disproportionate amount of reach engagement and attention in comparison to other platforms and right now Instagram is fighting pretty hard to come out on top with over two billion monthly active users Instagram is a giant and it pretty much doesn't matter what business or Market or industry you're in the ODS are pretty good that you're going to find a substantially large chunk of your ideal target market present active and engaging on the platform sadly your competitors know this too which is why the variable to success isn't just showing up that's a given but rather showing up in the right way with the right kind of content but if you asked most people why they think some things go viral while other pieces of content go completely ignored you're likely to hear something along the lines of it just being pure dumb luck chance maybe fate some freak occurrence that caused a magical piece of content to get millions if not billions of Impressions but the fact is while nobody can guarantee that a specific piece of content is going to rack up hundreds of millions of views there are certain characteristics and elements that all pieces of viral content seem to have in common in other words you can't make something go viral but if something is going to go viral it's probably going to have these elements in it elements that you can learn and use and apply to give all of your content the highest likelihood of success possible in his book contagious author Jonah Burger shares what makes things popular get shared and go viral and there are a few very practical and actionable takeaways that I want to share with you now starting with emotion most viral content delivers some kind of emotional charge whether positive through feelings of awe excitement or humor or negative through things like anger for instance anxiety now I'm not saying you need to go out there and get people all fired up all the time but it is important to understand that emotions are far more powerful driver in sales and marketing than just straight up logic and facts could ever hope to be the next element is practical value people share things that help other people not only does this make them feel good by helping someone else out but it also makes them look good themselves through a psychological phenomenon known as the halo effect whereby sharing good things people are more likely to associate good things with you next is triggers which is one of the most interesting and Powerful viral factors of all triggers are sights and sounds and other stimuli that remind us of related products and ideas the perfect example of this is when nasau landed a Rover on Mars and Mars The Chocolate Bar about the planet saw an increase in sales because of all the media tension that Mars the planet was getting now I appreciate you may not own a business named after a planet but that doesn't mean you can't find other ways to associate your product or service or offer or message with something else like the marketing firm crn did when they introduced Kit Kat and coffee to Consumers to get them to enjoy a Kit Kat bar whenever they take a coffee break so to help you do that and so much more I've linked up a video right here with some of my very best marketing strategies that'll show you exactly what's working best right now and how to apply it in your business and marketing so make sure to tap or click

marketing plan can be broken down into 6 very
simple steps that anyone can follow to get results. Yes. Even if you are just getting started. And that is exactly what I'm gonna share with you in this video. I am revealing the exact

of a solid marketing plan. Step one, get clear on who you are. I have said it once, I have
said it a million times. If you wanna be successful, no
matter what product, service niche or business you have,
then you have to get clear on who you are and how
to communicate that. Yeah, you need to crystallize

every single thing you do in your business, it
guides your communication. It informs literally all of your marketing efforts and campaigns. So this really does need to be one of the very first things
that you can consider when you're starting to look
at your marketing plan. Ask yourself, what do
I want to be known for? What are my non-negotiables? What are the things that I value? What is the change I
wanna see in my industry? How do I wanna serve my audience? What is my brand promise? So in total, there are
actually 11 messaging elements that you need to
take into consideration in order to build a very solid
brand messaging strategy. And yes, you know, I got you. I have broken them all down for you inside my free
brand voice checklist. So make sure to check that
out at the end of this video if you need a little TLC
in the branding department. Alright, so that leads us to the second step of
any solid marketing plan. Step two, get to know your customers like really get to know them. Now, I know you've
heard me say this before but if you try to sell to everyone you'll end up selling to no one. And this is true, no
matter what type of awesome, universal, helps-everybody
and-their-dog type of product or service you have. If you wanna sell anything to anyone you need to form an emotional
connection with them first. And in order to do that, you
need to speak their language. And in order to do that you need to talk about their core values the things that drive them
to take action, their deepest darkest desires and fears that either motivate
them or hold them back. You get the picture. So let me give you a really good example from a brand that I love. So let's say I am selling T-shirts to men. T-shirts, right? They are widely available,
a basic commodity and they're basically for everyone, right? The market is incredibly saturated. I mean, there is nothing more
common than a plain white T. So in order to stand out and get customers in a market like that you really need to know
your customer, like really really know them, and
then be able to directly address their biggest values, desires and challenges in your marketing. You need to speak their language. And a brand that does this really really well is a brand
called True Classic Tees. They sell T-shirts for
men, but they have a very specific USP and target
a very specific audience. Their shirts transform dads into daddies. They know their audience
better than anyone else. They're speaking to men who wanna look hot in T-shirts they wear, even if they have a little bit of a dadbod. And Hey, I love a good dadbod and a dadbod in a nice shirt. Hell yeah. So the bottom line is this get to know who you're selling to and so much of the hard
work is already done and now you are ready to
move on to step number three identify your positioning strategy. Alright, so the first
thing you need to do when you're building out your
positioning strategy is research. I know, I know research
everyone's favorite thing to do right? Well, it can be really fun even if it is a little bit time-consuming but I promise it is well
worth it no matter what. You do not want to skip this step. You wanna know what your
market is searching for and how you can serve them in
a way that no one else does. This is your USP your unique selling proposition
and how you stand out. And one of the best places
to start this process is by doing simple keyword research. Understanding the best
keywords to use will not only give you insight into what your audience
is actually looking for but will help you figure out
what other people are doing and how you can do it better. Now remember, just because someone is
selling something similar to you doesn't make it a bad thing. In fact, it's proof of concept that there is a market
for what you have to offer and that is a really, really good thing. Now, I am not an SEO expert but I do know that
using the right keywords in your marketing can also
help you ranked on Google which hey is just an added benefit. And yes, right here on YouTube too if you plan on creating video content. So the first thing that I
suggest you do is to make a list of all the things your business does or is here are some examples from my brand the Copy Posse: copywriting,
digital marketing content marketing, social media marketing email marketing, storytelling,
freelancing, copywriting courses and programs,
branding courses and programs, sales page courses and programs,
email marketing courses and programs and marketing
courses and programs. Okay, this is kind of a generic list. Now these keywords are fine to use but I definitely wouldn't focus only on these because let's be honest these keywords are extremely popular which means other people
are gonna be using them and targeting them in their marketing. And the more competition
your keywords have the harder it will be for you to actually rank
with them and stand out. So this is where the research phase really really comes into play. You wanna accumulate a list
of other relevant keywords and questions that your
audience is actually asking. The things they search for.
The things they care about. And there are a lot of tools you can use for research like this,
like Tube Buddy, vidIQ, Answer the public, Google
AdWords Keyword Planner, Moz Keyword Analysis, Ubersuggest, and yes even chatGPT. And then there's the good
old classic Google search. Just type into the search
engine, a keyword or a phrase and look at all the related
search results that populate at the bottom of the screen. These are all suggestions for a reason. They are highly searched
terms by your target audience. So the name of the game
here is really just to understand your audience and
what they're searching for. And of course, another
great way to use Google in your research phase is to check out the websites that are actually ranking in the top few spots of Google. Those are your competitors. What are they doing? What kind of content do they share? What offers do they have? And what can you do better or different? This is gonna give you
a lot of great intel to the best place to
start for your next step which is step number four,
create your content strategy. So the next thing you wanna
do is map out the main topics and the related subtopics
that you'll post content about. Now, of course, you wanna take into consideration your keywords
but ultimately the purpose of your content isn't
just to be searchable but to also be highly valuable and interesting to your audience. Trust me on this one I learned the hard way and I
got really bored really fast. The other thing to remember is that people don't only
wanna know what you do they wanna know who you are. Educational, how to type
of content is only one type of content that people care about. So come up with a list of topics and subtopics that you'd
be interested in talking about and throw in plenty
of stories and anecdotes from your experience and
personal life as well. Be fresh and interesting. First, that is what people want today. And if you follow my 5x5x5 strategy then you'll end up with 125
content ideas that you can pull from over the course of the
next several months to show up consistently across
multiple social channels without reaching that dreaded moment. Every content creator comes to: what am I going to post today? Omnichannel marketing is very important to build your brand awareness, and I know that that can sound a
little bit overwhelming but I promise you there are simple systems and processes that you
can implement to make all of this like a million times easier. So I actually go into my entire omnichannel
marketing strategy and how to create fresh and fun content inside my
brand-new marketing program Storm. For the first time ever, like ever I am revealing everything

insider strategies proven and repeatable processes and customizable marketing
blueprints that you can apply immediately

description box below to check out Storm my brand new program. I am so excited about it. Alright, so now that you have your
content strategy in motion it's time to consider the next
step of your marketing plan which is step number five,
build a marketing funnel. So up until this point,
we've been talking a lot about your front-end
marketing efforts, right? And while this may not generate
leads or sales directly it is gonna make your funnel
so much more effective. So when it comes to creating your funnel you have a lot of different
options that you could try. You could do a webinar
funnel, a quiz funnel a free trial funnel,
a coaching call funnel with literally a million combinations of upsells and downsells
and everything in between. But let me ease your mind just a little. All you need is one simple
funnel to get started. That is all I used. That is all you need right now. And then of course you can always test and expand from there. So the basic funnel that I
recommend looks something like this. First, you need traffic so you can do this organically or paid. Now, organic traffic will come from all the hard work you did earlier with your keywords & strategically
planning your content and that is why that is so important. But also, you could pay for traffic as well
through say advertising. So next up are leads. So again, there are a lot
of ways to build your leads but I find the most
effective way is simply offering something highly
valuable for free in exchange for an email address,
usually called a lead magnet which you will also create an
opt-in or landing page for. And of course, I offered you
my free brand voice checklist which you can get at
the end of this video. And that is an example of
a lead magnet in action. And now once you've got
those leads, the next step of the funnel is to
actually nurture those leads and build relationships and awareness and loyalty for your brand. So you typically don't wanna
try selling a brand new lead an expensive product right off the gate. First you wanna nurture
them, maybe offer them a lower ticket product
that's an easier yes. Then send your leads a series of emails to welcome and
indoctrinate them into your brand. Let them know what they can expect from you and what they
should be excited about. And then this is the most important part stay in their inbox consistently. So this means showing up
with your email marketing and sending out regular emails
on a consistent schedule. And lastly, of course, the point of why we're doing all of this is to sell. Now, of course, you don't
wanna lead with that right out the gate, but that is
why we are all in business. So generally speaking for
this, you'll need a sales page and an email sequence
designed to promote your offer but you can also use a webinar or any other sort of sales tools. So I like to run my
offers for about one week at a time and send out an
email every day to my list. But there are a lot of different frequencies and
cadences that you can consider. You'll also wanna cross promote on your social media channels throughout your promotion period and ultimately continue and continue and continue to nurture that
relationship with your list. Now, I have an entire
video that actually breaks down this exact funnel step by step. And if you want that, I'll link to that at the end of this
video for you to watch next. Now we're moving on to the next step of your marketing plan which is step number six,
monitor metrics and test. I cannot tell you how
important this step is. Marketing is just one giant experiment. At the end of the day, there
is no one right way to do it. Data driven decision making
is your ultimate goal. So really put on that
scientist cap that mindset of: ""Hey we're gonna try it all
out and see what works."" Now in the beginning,
you might not have that much data to go off of, and that's okay. Remember, everyone starts somewhere. But as soon as you can you should be monitoring your metrics. You wanna see what's
working so that you can do more of that, of course but then you also wanna
see what's not working so that you can maybe pivot or
change course and direction. Now, this looks like running ads and seeing which ones are most successful or monitoring the open
and click-through rates on your emails or seeing
which offers are actually selling more or converting more. And where does the majority of traffic in your business come from? Where do the majority
of the buyers come from? All of this information is
really gonna help you zone in and create more targeted
offers for the right people which is sort of the name of the game. But remember, marketing is not linear and it is always changing. So what worked last month
might not work this month and might not work next
month, and that is okay. That is why you test and
no matter what, stay true to you and continually
revisit everything you mapped out in step one. Because remember, as a
passionate entrepreneur you have the creative superpower
to literally change lives. And it is your duty to protect
that superpower at all costs and stay focused on the
impact you are here to make. And this is a reminder that I have to give myself all the time. It is so, so hard to stay in your lane when there
are a million people out there blowing hot smoke up your butt telling you what's the next
best thing to focus on. And while it's fun to
chase the white rabbit down every hole you find you've got
to build your own wonderland and remember why you are here or you'll just end up burned
or straight up burnt out. People always ask me, ""Alex how did you build a recognizable brand and a successful business and a loyal fan base in just 3 years?"" And honestly, if I had to
sum it up in one sentence my answer would be this. I trusted my creativity. I listened to my community and I paired what's
working in the market today with the timeless marketing
principles that have worked for me consistently over the past decade. Everything that I shared
with you in this video and now I wanna share all of my best marketing strategies with you a proven blueprint that's
rooted in marketing truths and that is exactly what I teach you in my upcoming brand-new
video coaching program Storm. So if you want my insider strategies proven and repeatable processes and a customizable marketing

Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_GdEyEBDY,[Music] your Instagram marketing strategy isn't working as well as you want right now because things have changed and what used to work even a few

you what's actually working and giving you actionable strategies that you can apply right now to grow faster and get instantly better results for you your business or any business you want to apply this to here's what we're going to cover I'll show you the best kind of content to post because not all content is created equal and I'll give you the best time to post it so that your content has the best chance of success possible I'll also give you proven and profitable strategies to increase engagement get more followers so much more essentially you're getting a behind the scenes look at the exact same strategies I use whenever I'm creating social media marketing campaigns for companies like meta Amazon Google Adobe canva Logitech and many more so with that said let's Dive Right In starting with a quick look at how the Instagram algorithm works so you can use it to your advantage also a big thank thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video but more on that later as fancy and complicated as the Instagram algorithm might sound sometimes it's actually pretty straightforward so if your account isn't growing as fast as you were hoping or your content isn't getting the reach that you expected it's usually just because the algorithm is having a hard time doing its job but don't worry because once you know what the algorithm is looking for you can simply follow the rest of the tips that I'm going to be giving you throughout this video in order to make the algorithm work to your advantage you see the algorithm only has two jobs number one to find content for people that they might enjoy and number two to show them as much of this enjoyable content as possible so they stay on the platform forever and ever and ever so the secret then is to help the algorithm by being clear about who your account is for and then optimizing your content for your fans followers and audience because if they like it then so will the algorithm and one of the best first steps that you can take to do do this is to optimize your bio if you want to grow your Instagram account then you need to give people a reason to follow you and your bio is the perfect place to make that happen first make sure your name is clear but you also might want to include a relevant title or keyword or some kind of a statement to help people instantly understand what you do then use the first line to describe what you do think of this as a good opportunity to showcase your USP or unique selling proposition use the second line to describe why you're worth following if you have any social proof you can put it here otherwise you can give someone another reason like daily tips on XYZ or content designed to help you ABC all these letters for the third line out of CTA or call to action that tells people what to do next and then use the link in your bio to send people to the next step in your marketing funnel or customer Journey whatever you want them to do next another easy win in the bio department is to use story Highlights Highlights are an easy place to condent some of your best and most important work as well as Drive traffic to your offers and to your business aim for three to four story highlights and see if you can create a highlight for each one of the following categories first a highlight about who you are what you do some kind of introduction or indoctrination into your world next a highlight reel of your best work these could be a portfolio uh results case studies testimonials anything that actually shows that you know what you're doing third showcasing some of your best pieces of content is a pretty good idea here as it'll further establish you as an expert or authority on the subject and then finally consider adding a story highlight that offers a lead Magnet or something that you can use to get them onto an email newsletter okay next I'm going to share with you what kind of content is working best on the platform right now and after that I've got some really important info to share around what is the best time to post in order to make sure that your content gets seen by as many people as possible but first I've got something to share with you that I think you're really going to find helpful you see HubSpot recently came out with their value packed and completely free social media trends report to help you create a winning social media strategy by giving you an exclusive look into how people engage across social both personally and professionally for example if you're curious about how AI is disrupting marketing then you'll be

HubSpot social media trends report today now let's talk about what kind of content to post and the best time to post it [Music] when it comes to what kind of content to post or what format to use I've got some good news for you especially if you're scared to post videos or have heard that reals are the only way to grow because while it's no secret that reals have indeed been getting a lot of attention over these past few years they're not the only way to grow and to get attention the real secret to consistent and predictable growth is to find a style and content format that works for you so here's how I think of it and break it down for people text and graphic based posts work just fine single are good but if you can create Carousel style posts you're likely to see an uptick in engagement and growth for most of your content you want to stay focused around a single area or Niche but stories are a really good opportunity to go off topic and talk about things and themes that are outside of your Niche or primary area of focus the part about staying focused is really important so I'm going to show you how to train the algorithm to attract more of your ideal followers in just a minute if you can do video though then do video reals stories lives if you're up for it video just gives you a ton of flexibility and you also have the power to repurpose your content on other platforms like Facebook and Tik Tok and YouTube even Twitter Pinterest and Linkedin as for how much and how often you should be posting the fact is more really is better but consistency is the most important thing of all is you don't want to make a bunch of posts burn yourself out and then disappear for 6 months a solid schedule to stick to that's going to deliver some serious growth and engagement is posting a feed post at least once a day making it a carousel if you really want to up your game creating short quick easy and unfiltered stories two to three times a day going live once or twice a week can provide an additional boost and then creating anywhere from 3 to seven reels a week is a really healthy number all right brace yourself for this one because it's going to sound pretty silly at first but I promise I'm going to give you some more context and show you how this all works in just a second the best time to post on Instagram is the time that most of your followers are online I know that was deep and the way to see that is by going to your profile clicking insights then followers and scrolling down to the bottom to find most active times but if you're just getting started you don't have that many followers yet or you just can't find that section in your account then there are some really helpful guidelines that you can follow for most people most of the time you really can't go wrong by posting around 8: or 9:00 a.m. if you're going to post two or three times a day then post your second one at 11:00 a.m. and the third one at 3:00 p.m. Mondays to Fridays are usually best and Sunday is typically the worst performer the times suggested are meant to be in your local time zone or if you're attracting an international audience then use the local time zone where most of your followers are you can also look at other industry leaders and big accounts in your Niche to see what days and times they're posting their content actually while we're on the topic of looking at your competitors and colleagues in the space we might as well talk about the next Point as well which is how to train the Instagram algorithm to work for you if you remember back at the beginning when I said the algorithm only has two jobs number one to content for people that they might enjoy well this is where you can help the algorithm connect people with your content by training it warming it up a little bit essentially showing the algorithm what your account is all about now you already did some of this by optimizing your bio but you can take this a step further by going out there and following liking and commenting on other relevant and related accounts in your space for example if you're in the fitness industry well you should be following other Fitness accounts engaging with their content commenting on their posts see saving some maybe even sharing some to your stories not only does this help train the algorithm but it also has the added benefit of putting your account in front of their followers which gives you even more opportunities to attract your ideal audience using a little something I call fan fishing it's not as weird as it sounds fan fishing takes advantage of the fact that there are larger Instagram accounts out there who have already spent time and money and energy building up an audience of your ideal followers and 10 minutes a day engaging with and commenting on other relevant accounts in your Niche is all it takes for a solid fan fishing strategy to pay off the key here though is to provide real and genuine comments engage in actual conversations and show yourself off as the amazing value providing person I know you are following everyone in the space and then simply copying and pasting comments like I agree this is great is only going to get you so far and people can see through that kind of nonsense from a mile away so this is one of those things that you either want to do it right or don't bother doing it at all and if you don't want to do it at all well that's cool with me because there are still many more things that you can do to boost your growth including one of the most important but least talked about things of all captions captions also known as the little word things that appear beside below or over your posts are one of the most underrated tools available to you as someone who is trying to grow your brand and business first because of keywords and the fact that you can include relevant and important keywords throughout your captions and content which further helps to Signal the algorithm as well as your ideal audience about what your content is about keywords also help keep you on track as you know what you should and need to be talking about rather than spiraling off in a million different directions next story your captions are a great place to provide added context to your post and often the captions aren't just a nice to have thing but are completely necessary to help make whatever you just posted make sense H look at that cat third a CTA also known as a call to action something that provides your viewer with the next step to take or next move to make next action that they should be doing for example follow for more or send me a DM as for ctas the only thing to avoid is probably the most common one of all which is linkoln bio you are so much better off asking people to leave a comment or DM you for more info than the generic Lincoln bio CTA fourth polls in captions a relatively new feature that allows you to put a poll right there in the captions it's powerful stuff and an incredibly important market research and engagement boosting tool fifth has TS a topic we should probably break out into its own section now is there's still so much confusion and misinformation around this topic so the big question about hashtags is do they still work and the big answer to that big question is yes kind of I mean not like a ton some people don't even really use them at all they're doing fine but they're still good sort of anyway the truth is this one's kind of messy but it's also one of the best opportunities to talk about a marketing strategy I call do as I did not as do what this means is that often people will look at big accounts in their space notice they're not using any hashtags at all they're not even writing captions certainly not good ones and they're not following any other proven piece of advice and yet their accounts are huge well my friend that's usually because what they're doing now is dramatically different from what they did to get where they are the fact is there are different strategies for every stage of the game and while the debate is still out on just how useful hashtags actually are there does seem to be some agreement that at the very least they're a good insurance policy as in they might help but they definitely don't hurt so here's how to use them first find anywhere from 5 to 15 different hashtags that are relevant to your account then try to make sure you've got at least a few from each category of big hashtags medium and small a big hashtag would be something like business which is going to appeal to Millions medium one might be digital marketing tips which is going to appeal to a much smaller segment and then a small one would be something like Instagram marketing tactics more directly related to your specific Niche brand business or offer next and this Point's important make sure to put these hashtags in the actual captions part of the post and not as a comment below it or it's not going to have any positive impact at all all that said the real secret to accelerating your growth not just on Instagram but for your entire business and brand is to make sure that you're using proven and profitable marketing strategies and principles things that are actually going to work to get you more customers and make you more sales so to help you with that

4Ap7yl4X8Zo,5 BRAND NEW Digital Marketing Strategies for 2024 (HUGE Leap Forward!),Unknown,326367,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Ap7yl4X8Zo/hq720.jpg,2023-11-28 00:00:00,836,Wes McDowell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ap7yl4X8Zo,the difference between marketing your business in 2023 and what you can achieve in 2024 is going to be a huge leap forward and it's all thanks to AI but how do you use it right and do way more with less and avoid tanking your business by using it wrong in this video we're going to hit all five major digital marketing categories where I'm going to show you the single tactic that's working best for each in 2024 and the best way to use AI to help you supercharge it and do more in a whole lot less time I'll even help you avoid the traps that most businesses fall into when they use AI the wrong way so let's start with our first category content marketing now here's a truth that I've discovered over the past few years the businesses that make it that really take off in a big way do it by offering information on the front end then selling on the back end and what this comes down to is putting out helpful content on a regular basis that people they potential customers can find then watch listen to or read and begin to form a little relationship with you in the process that relationship can easily triple your leads and it costs about 62% less than traditional advertising now obviously I chose to go all in on videos for my content marketing but there's something that can work even better when it comes to relationship building and that's podcasting think about it people usually listen to podcasts all the way through sometimes over an hour at a time and going really long form like that lets you fast track that relationship like you wouldn't believe but there's always been a big problem with podcasts so when you write articles people can find it through a Google search when you make a video and put it on YouTube they'll find you an audience for it but with podcasts discoverability is notoriously hard mostly because the platforms that host podcasts don't really care if people find your sh show or not so your new podcast would have traditionally had a really hard time finding an audience but there's a new player in podcasting you may have heard of it it's YouTube they've been quietly dipping their toes in the podcasting arena for over a year now and they're finally making it a huge priority for them so 2024 is the year of a kind of hybrid content type the video podcast so you can still upload the audio to all the traditional places like apple podcast Spotify all those guys but you can also upload the video version right here onto YouTube where you're much more likely to find your audience because that's what YouTube does best and there are podcasts in every single business nich you can think of but now comes the fun part actually coming up with the topics that you can talk about that would really closely align with what you actually do as a business and AI can definitely help you out here this one's not super super surprising chat GPT but how you use it is what's going to make this such a powerful tool for you you just start with this prompt you're an expert content creator in the fill-in-the blank Niche list out 50 topics for a podcast about X for an audience of why then just keep track of the ones that make the most sense that you'd actually want to talk about in a spreadsheet then take the ones you like and one at a time just ask chat gbt for a detailed podcast outline for that topic and then take one final pass at it yourself and add in your own bullet points highlighting your own experiences opinions and your own advice this is an incredible timesaver when you don't have to start from a blank page and then when you add in your own flavor as a final step you won't be making that mistake that most people make when they use chat GPT to create their content it's giving you the raw talking points but you'll be delivering it in your own way in your own voice and that's that's what makes this strategy so powerful and yeah you might be thinking easy for you to say Wes but setting up a podcast sounds hard honestly it's not as hard as it sounds as long as you have a couple of key elements you can totally start a podcast using nothing but a smartphone along with an affordable external mic I happen to use the road podcaster and I'm going to leave a link to it below if you wanted to pick one up then you just need a nice looking background you know since this is video you got to do better than a bare white wall or you know sitting on your bed and honestly this isn't really any different from the background in a zoom meeting you know you just need a semi put together well-lit setting with maybe some you know books and plants and really that's it you know the advantage of video podcasting is you can create a lot of content without a lot of heavy investment on your end you know you can get away with a simple AI editing program and you can even look to your outline off a computer screen that's just to the side of your camera and you're golden and there's actually another hidden reason why a video podcast is so beneficial right now more on that in a minute but for now let's just move on to our next digital marketing category social media marketing if you've been paying attention to where social's going over the past year you know that those short form vertical videos are still where it's at but what kind of shorts are working best right now across Instagram reels Tik Tock and YouTube shorts believe it or not it's stuff like this these are absolutely dominating all the shorts platforms and if it looks familiar it's because these are basically just repurposed video podcast Clips yep if you went all in on video podcasting you get to double dip into all these social media platforms too with pretty much no extra effort once again thanks to AI now there are tons of AI tools like get Munch and video who will not only chop up your long firm videos into short social media ready Clips like these but they'll do the the hard work of choosing which bits have the most viral potential in the first place so without any extra work you could end up with dozens of Tik Tok or Instagram ready Clips YouTube LinkedIn even Pinterest you can post these everywhere automatically and you don't even have to think about which Clips are going to work best my advice having both short and long form videos online is going to help you the most you know both types of video are going to be top of funnel Discovery tools for your business in 2024 someone who likes one of your short videos might check out your podcast and suddenly they're all in on your funnel when people see you in both places you'll essentially achieve what we call omnipresence that being everywhere effect and that repetition helps you build deeper connections faster but what if you don't have time to sit down and record long form podcasts or if you just know you're not going to actually do it here's a great tip from social media expert Vanessa Lao she suggests creating a fake podcast most times people who do this style don't even have a podcast and their mic isn't even plugged in all they have is a podcast mic not plugged in they're looking to an angle and they're just talking as if they were talking to someone on a podcast that has been proven to work especially when we look at the metrics of Engagement and of the retention on these videos and so it is something that you might want to consider trying especially if you are someone who's not ready to have a full-blown podcast just yet so I'll leave that up to you just make sure that your mic's actually plugged in or you might just get some trolls pointing it out and blowing your cover that's right you're a big fat fony now I do recommend these clips being around 1 to 3 minutes long which is longer than I recommended in the past and the simple reason is that all these shorts platforms are having a really hard time monetizing those super short videos you know slotting ads in between 6C click Clips is just really hard to do as it turns out so for 2024 The Sweet Spot is short but not too short and you'll notice the same thing everywhere Tik Tok YouTube and even Instagram is starting to push videos longer than a minute long now if you want the biggest bang for your book I recommend sitting down for those long form video podcasts then letting AI chop it up into the best 1 to 3 minute Clips then posting across all your platforms you know you may only do 1 hour a week but anyone watching your social media will think you're practically doing content creation as a full-time job they'll see you they'll appreciate your deep Dives and they'll start to trust you and that my friend is how you scale a business in 2024 now ai had a pretty unexpected negative consequence on marketing this past year used to be you'd create great content for your website you'd optimize it for search and you just might rank your blog post and even Sal sales Pages for your keywords that you wanted to be found for but now that Google and Bing have gotten their paws all over their own AI tools they're actually starting to deliver search results in a new way rather than showing your article as an answer to a searcher's question they're planning on just answering it themselves through an aid driven chatbot so when it comes to our third marketing category search engine marketing I would recommend a pretty big pivot here so specifically in 2024 you need to be focusing on one of two types of search-based content option one you could go all in on deep experience-based written content so I'm talking articles that go beyond answering a simple question simply you know think about it like this if the keyword phrase you're trying to rank for could be easily answered by AI you shouldn't be going for that phrase anymore the good news is though many people are searching for answ ansers that do go a little deeper that require a real human with all their real experiences hard one knowledge an expert opinions and those are the types of articles that you should now be focusing on or option two stop trying so hard to rank in Google and try to rank on YouTube instead that's right don't think of YouTube as social media it really isn't what it is is the world's second largest search engine so why not go all in on video content that AI is going to have a much harder time replacing sure there are AI generated channels but I turn them off pretty quick and I bet you do too I don't know a single person alive who would rather watch a video made up of b-roll clips and a fake voice over than a real person with real experiences and an actual personality so look through your content and then concentrate on the topics that only a real human can answer what's the content that comes from your direct experiences you know create more stuff like that you can still use chat GPT for your first drafts but if you want better performance in search engines you'll have to do chat gbt one better so layer in your human experiences include anecdotes from your life or work inject a few opinions and take a stance on some issues let's say your business is selling personal finance coaching you know you help people get out of debt so if you create plain old generic content you might have chat gbt spit out some quick articles like five ways to get out of debt inject your experience though and suddenly people have more reason to read you know maybe you think the debt snowball method is superior to the Avalanche method and your article defending the reasons why then relate them back to when you got out of debt yourself you know you can still use chat GPT for your base content but you're also going one layer deeper taking a stance defending it and giving Google's users something to think about not just a quick bite and of course all these digital marketing categories up till now all exist to move people deeper and deeper into your sales funnel and the goal for all these people you've connected with so far should be to get them onto your email list where you can take it even deeper faster yep email marketing is still the king when it comes to converting interested prospects into paying customers the only catch is you've got to get them on your list in the first place and we typically do that by offering a free lead magnet in exchange for their email address but lead magnets are changing you know in the past you might have offered a free ebook or PDF and that can work okay the average written lead magnet converts at about 22.8% but the conversion rate of people who take a quiz is almost double that at 40% so that's twice as many leads on your email list with one simple switch the problem's always been that creating a quiz can be a pretty tedious and confusing process but AI can help you here as well use try interacts new AI quiz Builder just fill in some basic information and let them take over from there and once it's finished you can just embed the whole thing right on your website but how will you get people to your site to actually opt in for it that brings us to the last category on our list paid marketing so for my money there is no better way to spend advertising budget than to spend it on getting people on my email list and meta AKA Facebook or Instagram ads are still the best way to do it but the AI solution for making these ads work extra hard for you is where this really gets good in 2024 and I've got the entire playbook for you right here just click through to get all my best prompts so you can use chat GPT like a personal ad writer and marketing manager because if you don't learn it someone else in your industry will by the time 2024 is over

Hormozi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITff1fIbSc,"people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days they're somehow going to blow up in the beginning 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better I got a DM the other day somebody who was like yeah it's easy for you to build this brand because you already have this big audience I was like dude just start he was discouraged by the fact that he had no following he had no audience Etc 99% of people who are watching this do more cool and then you'll have cool to talk about rather than regur shating other people's stuff but for everyone who sees the overnight success right what I want you to do is go to my podcast and look at the timestamp on my first episode it's 2017 5 and 1 half 6 years ago it just now hit the top 10 and in that six-year period I did not miss every week 1 to three podcasts for six years and so people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days they're somehow going to blow up when the reality is that you're finding your voice for the first year you're figuring out what way you communicate you're learning how to teach how to entertain how to present you're Lear Lear how to speak and you're also learning about the stuff that you're learning meantime right like in that period of time I might not have had as much stuff that was as cool in the beginning that applied to as many people cuz the first 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better right around 150 I started talking about Marketing in general because that's what I was into at the time and then I start talking about sales and I start talking about business in general and m&a and things as they've evolved over time and so the subject matter as well as my skill in delivering it both improved over that period of time and now the podcast is top 10 on entrepreneurship and very high ranked in business next to names that I I looked up to my whole career I'm like holy cow I'm like we're wait we just went above this guy that I've been looking up to my whole life it doesn't take 90 days it takes years if you think in days the time's going to pass no matter what but if you can think in decades when you make your goals when that decade does pass it'll show that you were thinking that way right not the outcome of the goal make the action the goal if the action is did I make the post did I make the reach outs every day then you're a success you check both boxes I want to tell you a quick story so there was a guy who started at the first gym with me same day all right and we've been friends since then and I started my gym and then he started his gym and he started chain of gym so we went in parallel all right and he ended up selling those gyms and he wanted to go online he was like dude I need to build like a brand and I was like dude you just need to start posting you know short form stuff making stuff that's valuable he posted every day for 6 months and then one video took off and then the next video took off and the next video took off and then all all of a sudden now he's making $100,000 a month from the content that he was making he'd already been doing business for 9 years and then all of a sudden it took off and he and he messaged me he was like I'm super grateful that that you told me to do that and so he did the post and he did the reach outs and what ended up happening is that earlier on he would he would have videos that would start taking off he would start doing reach outs you start making sales and then you'd make some money and then you would slow down and then all of a sudden you get in scarcity mode once he was like oh shoot there's no money coming in there's no money coming in and then you start making content start doing rots again and you make money again and he was like dude how do I break the cycle and what we did was we shifted what he was focusing on because he was focusing on the sales he was making he was focusing on the money he was making rather than focusing on the process you are not successful in my eyes because whenever you see some outcome you stop the activities which means you don't have the trait of consistency I was like the reason you aren't where you want to be is because you can't do things repeatedly and so most people can't do one thing over and over again you need to be able to do the doing without seeing the result of your doing and you have to keep doing it and if you can keep doing things independent and this is both ways if it goes really well you keep doing the thing that got you there and if it's not going well comma yet you keep doing the thing so that you get good enough that one day it will and that's the shift that most people don't make and I think that's why most people just stick war and the reality is that if you can commit to the actions and the behaviors and the traits that you will grow through doing then at the end of this process a decade later you will be the type of person who can do something for a long period of time and wait and I promise you that if you have that trait money will never be a constraint in your life and this is from Atomic habits every winner and every loser have the same goals so when you measure Yourself by having this external thing and people are like set goals everyone wants to be rich everyone wants to have a six-pack your goals don't make you unique it's the activities that you do that make you unique the goal of the winner is to commit to the activities the goal of the loser is to commit to the goal 52% of 18-year-olds High School seniors think they're going to be millionaires by 25 the world is going to be shook many of you will fail and that's because most of you have the same goal 50% of you think you're going to be a Millionaire right that's just math but only a small percentage will because if you want to be a millionaire you're not going to focus on making the million dollars you're going to focus on the stuff that makes a million dollars and so when you can divorce the activities from the outcome then you can focus on the doing which whether your income does this over that period of time your self-esteem Remains the Same because you're committ to what you can control if you can make that shift it will change your life so I started making podcast 6 years ago I committed to that process when I signed on with a a YouTube vendor a few years ago on the first call I said I'd like to have this channel be something in 5 to 10 years I was like We'll look at it then and see if it was worth continuing to do I was like but I'm in for a decade and he stopped me afterwards he was like I've literally never had a client say that to me ever he's like they're all like how can I get leads in the first 90 days from YouTube and like blah blah blah I was like if we're making progress I'm good I will commit to that I think that if you can think that way you will get what you want and then people will ask you a decade from now man how did you have this overnight success and blah blah blah blah blah and aren't you like don't the followers and the fans like how does it not get to your head and you're like cuz it was never the goal and so I feel just as good at year one as I do at year eight because the activities that I committed to were remain the same if you can think that way and you can shift your perspective persective it will it'll decrease your emotional ups and downs and I think we all need ways to decrease our emotional ups and downs in the game of business because like we need to have second lives and third lives and fourth lives and the way to do that is to not put your life your game playing life in something that you can't control but putting all your game playing life in the things you can right now we just crossed our 400th episode 400 episodes like if I did one a week that's 52 four eight one a week for a year that would be eight years of doing that if I had 400 episodes I'm at like year six if you make 400 long form pieces of content I guarantee you that your following would be bigger than it is today well how long is that going to take as long as it takes because the goal was never the outcome the goal was to do it thing"
IjS9eTpmhgk,10 Marketing Strategies Guaranteed to Grow ANY Business (PROVEN & PROFITABLE),Unknown,700371,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IjS9eTpmhgk/hq720.jpg,2022-08-15 00:00:00,1730,Adam Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjS9eTpmhgk,"- Hey there, my friend. Adam here. And today I wanna walk you
through 10 marketing tips and tactics and strategies, or rather give you a
framework and a playbook that you can use to create
marketing that works, that converts, that's profitable and helps you grow your business or any business you're working on. What this is going to help
you do is essentially any time that you're sitting down
and you're thinking of ways to generate new customers or
more leads or make more sales or launch a new campaign, it's gonna give you a framework
and a roadmap that you can follow from start all the
way to finish to make sure that you're doing the right
things in the right place for the right people, rather than just randomly
guessing and hoping and praying that this might
all just magically work, which let's be honest, isn't much better than gambling. And that makes no sense at all, especially when there is a far more proven and strategic path that you can follow, one that has been replicated thousands, if not tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of times, both for myself and for my
clients over the past 10 years. And one that I know that if
you follow and you work through what I'm about to share
with you will have amazing and positive effects on your business and your marketing as well. So with that said, let's dive right in. Now what you're looking at
right here is the original kind of brainchild behind
all of this, just a mess of words and of thoughts
and ideas all kind of tossed down on the paper, of course, in typical Adam
fashion being slightly a bit of a perfectionist, still working on it. Anyway, I cleaned it up a little bit. I made a better and
cleaner diagram for you and that's what I wanna
walk you through here today. Essentially starting in the middle and then working our way out. See, the problem is when most
people think about marketing, they think about business
planning and strategy and things like that, they view it
as this linear path like, I'm gonna do this and
then I'm gonna do that, and then it's gonna be followed
by this, when the reality is it's often a lot more of this
kind of roller coaster ride. We're gonna try this, we're
gonna get data and feedback, we're gonna look at the
analytics and the metrics. We're gonna pivot and adjust accordingly. Then we're gonna go in this direction, then we're gonna move this. Then we're gonna base those
decisions off everything we've just done and what
worked and what didn't. And it continually evolves
and you need to be able to evolve and adapt with it. All that said, there is a set of steps that you want to take. You don't want to just go
out there and start posting on random social media accounts because then nothing's going to work,
you're gonna get frustrated, you're gonna get burned out
and then you might just give up on the whole thing altogether. And that's not good for you, it's not good for the people
that you hope to serve. It's not good for anyone. So the very first thing that
you need to do anytime your launching a new campaign, whether it's an existing business or you're thinking of
starting a new business, is you need to start
right in the center here with the offer. Now, I could make you struggle
to understand my terrible handwriting like was
mocked up the time before, but I've taken the efforts
to go and let's see if this works, I don't
have perforated paper, but that worked better than
I thought, so here we are. Step number one is the offer. Now there's a bit of a debate
in the marketing community about when it comes to
starting a business, when it comes to growing
an existing business, do you focus on the offer
first or the target market? In other words, do you want to make something
and then find people to sell it to or do you wanna
find people that you can help and then make something
to solve their problems? No one seems to agree on
this, so we've got a solution. If you have a brand new business, you've never sold anything to anyone, you just have this idea in your mind, then typically
you're better off thinking about the people that you seek to serve. Those are going to be people
that you may have been one in the past or that you resonate
with or that you're currently a member of the group, and the reason is because the better that
you're able to understand your target markets and their
pains and problems and fears and frustrations and all
the things we're gonna talk about in just a minute, the better you're going to be
able to position your product or your service or your
offer as the solution to their pains and problems. On the flip side, if you already
have an existing business, you've been in business for any
length of time than the odds are good that you already
have a number of different products or services or
things that you're selling. So the key here is to be
specific and strategic and selective and make sure that
you're choosing the right offer with the best margins,
that is the most fun to deliver, that has the highest
potential for scalability, that's easy to sort of
market and clearly describe. So to recap all of that, if you've got a new
product or a new offer, something you're thinking of selling, do a little
bit of market research, find the ideal segment of
people that you can best serve and then make sure that
there's a match there. If you already have an existing business, the odds are good that you've
been selling something. So find out what it is
about that makes it unique, and then find the best
people that you can continue to serve by 80 20ing
your existing customers. Essentially taking a look at
the top 20% of your customers, what are their
commonalities, their traits? What do they sort of have in
common, where do they live? All of the things that we're gonna talk about in just a second
when it comes to market. All right, so that is our
offer and that's gonna form the core of everything that
we do from this point on, everything is going to be an
alignment with this offer. It's gonna be in service of this offer. Marketing is done and one
single offer at a time. You may have a number of
different things you can do or want to do, but that doesn't mean
you wanna blast somebody with all of your different
offers cuz it's going to lead to overwhelm and to confusion
and to this sort of paralysis by analysis, not knowing
what to do or how to do it and confused customers
don't buy, so we start here. Okay, so now that you've
got the offer in mind, the next thing that you
need to do is move on to this section here, goals. Now here's the deal, when
it comes to setting goals for your marketing, I'm not
a stickler for making sure that you set exact specific
measurable goals like we want to increase our cost of
acquisition or decrease our cost of acquisition by 3% or increase our leads by 22.8%, but I do need
you to have a north star, a guiding sort of area light
to work towards to make sure that you are going on the right
path rather than taking all of these completely irrelevant
paths and ending up somewhere completely different that's
not going to benefit you or your business or the
people that you seek to serve. Good example here is that
most business owners, most entrepreneurs, most marketers, sadly, they do marketing
for the sake of marketing, they were told that, Hey, we
need to do some marketing, we need to make some stuff. So they make some stuff and
then they put it out there and unsurprisingly it
doesn't resonate because it's just stuff, or they may
have the wrong kind of goal, which is creating stuff for
the sake of getting likes or comments or shares rather
than building a community and increasing engagement with
the right kind of people that will lead to leads that will
lead to customers that will lead to sales and revenue
and actual business growth. Now, fortunately, when it
comes to setting goals, the end goal is normally pretty simple. I mean it's going to be an increase in sales or an increase in revenue, and then all you have to do
is start to work your way backwards to assign
relevant metrics and KPIs known as key performance
indicators to make sure that everything's in alignment. For example, if you have a
thousand dollars product to sell and you know that you sell
it by phone and you close one in two sales, well now we figured out, well, we're gonna need two
sales calls to make one sale, and then, okay, well how many leads do we need to generate in order to have those two sales calls? And then how many clicks do
we need to get those leads? And you can start to work
your way back and at least it gives you sort of a right
direction to move towards. Okay, next up we are gonna draw the line, and this one is all about
target market, target market, possibly the most important
element in all of marketing. In fact, the word marketing, right? We've got market baked right into it. That's how important this
is, they are the core, the central component
of your entire campaign, the entire structure, everything you do is
about your target market and what's in service to them, you see, the reality is that when it comes to marketing, the customer doesn't buy when they understand, they
buy when they feel understood, and that's all about empathy,
it's about awareness, it's about being able to
put yourself in their shoes to view things from their perspective. See, the reason that a lot
of marketing doesn't work, doesn't connect with the target
market is because it's not relevant, it's not, it
doesn't resonate with them. They don't understand how this would apply to them and so they just tune
it out, good example here. If you've ever seen a
commercial or a YouTube or a Facebook ad or any kind of ad
or marketing material at all, and you've thought ""This is really dumb, like
seriously, this makes no sense, I don't even know what
they're trying to sell."" And if you do happen to figure out what they're trying to sell, you think ""What a dumb product,
who would ever buy that?"" and here's the thing,
the product, the service, whatever it is being sold might
not be dumb and the ad might actually be really good, but
you are not the target market. Now, sure, their targeting could be off. I don't know why you're
seeing the ad that's not meant for you, sometimes these things happen, but the point of the matter is that as long as you're specific
and relevant to the right kind of people, you will
get them to take action. They will be inspired to
want to get the solution to the problem that they have provided, that you've properly articulated this, that you've said the right
words in the right way at the right time. On the other hand, if you
water down your message by trying to appeal to
everybody out there, it becomes very bland and
very boring and very generic and then people just
automatically tune it out and you know exactly
what I'm talking about. Talking about the things or the ads, the marketing that says we
provide better service or faster delivery or we're superior or
whatever it is, first of all, these are not specific terms,
they're very ambiguous. They could mean a lot of
things to a lot of different people, second of all, pretty
much everybody can say them, therefore everybody does say them, therefore they mean nothing. Anyway, I'm gonna dive
into more of the specifics on that in just a second, but first, let's figure out your ideal target market, your ideal customer avatar,
also sometimes known as an ICA. And to do that we break it
down into three different categories, the first of which
is their demographic details. These are the stereotypical
things you think of when you think of marketing
and think of a target market, so age, gender, income,
occupation, titles, all of the things that are
just like the generic customer avatar right there, then
we have geographic details. What city, state, province,
country, principality, municipality, neighborhood,
where do they live basically. This is incredibly important
because there's going to be cultural differences
between not only different countries but also different
cities and sometimes even different neighborhoods
in different cities. And then of course you have the mother of all the psychographic
details, what are their values, their attitudes, their
lifestyles, their beliefs, what organizations are they a part of? Religious affiliations,
political leanings, all of that stuff. All of the things that are not polite to talk about around the dinner table. Those are the things
that you want to know. You want to get into their
head and you want to know kind of like what do they really
think about these things that we're not supposed to talk about. Now, I'm not suggesting
you make all of your ads and all of your marketing
directly call this stuff out, but it still is important
to keep in the back of your mind when you're creating
your marketing materials. What are these people going to like? What are they not going to like? What are they going to find
offensive and what is going to be polarizing but in a good
way that's gonna draw them in and really reject and repel
everybody else that you just don't wanna deal with? After target market, well, of
course we have to drill down into those psychographic
details even more, and to do that we're going
to sort of break apart, their miracles and miseries. Now, miracles miseries are
things that I've coined that essentially make up
the two different areas of your target market. They're miseries being their
fears and problems and pains and frustrations and nightmares
and all the things they're trying to get away from, and
their miracles being all of their wants and dreams and goals
and desires and aspirations and all the things that
they're trying to move towards. Every person, every target market, every business has a way to appeal to someone's miseries as
well as to their miracles. There's going to be different industries that lean one way more than another. There's going to be segments of the market that lean more one way or
another, in other words, if you use messaging that
help someone move away from pain, sometimes that's stronger, on the other hand, you have
more aspirational language, helping someone achieve something
and different markets are gonna benefit more from that. A decent mix of both is
usually the best path. We don't want to constantly
be negative and say, This is a horrible thing
and you need to get it fixed and blah, blah, blah. Otherwise you come to come
off as a Debbie Downer. On the other hand, if all your promising
is rainbows and sunshine and unicorns and all the
magical things in this world, while they're not gonna have
any reason to take action if you don't sort of back
that up with a little bit of pain, in other words, a solution without a problem
is completely meaningless. You need to put the solution in context to an actual problem that they have. Now, here's where things get good. The miracles and miseries
essentially form a gap A gap between where they're at
right now with all of the bad stuff going on and where they want to be with all of the good stuff
that they'd like to have. And it's your marketing's job
to help them bridge that gap away from miseries and towards
miracles and the better you're able to communicate
that and show how if you do these things, if
you acquire this product, if you use this service, if you take me up on this offer, you're going
to be able to have it. Well, the better you're able
to clearly communicate that, the better all of your marketing
and all of your sales are going to be, all right, moving on. Next up, we have present and active. Now, this one is a bit
of a pet peeve of mine. I've got a few different
marketing pet peeves, one of which is when I ask
someone who their target market is and they say everyone or
everyone in the world or people with money, and of course
as we've already covered, you can't be that broad, otherwise you end up
with completely boring and bland and irrelevant messages. The other pet peeve I have is when people, business owners,
entrepreneurs, marketers occasionally hear about
a new platform or a new social media channel or a
new marketing opportunity and they dive right in without
doing all of the things that we've just covered, all of the more important things
that need to happen first, identifying the model,
figuring out the target market, working out their miracles and miseries and all of those details. Instead, they just dive
headfirst into this new platform and make a bunch of stuff, nothing works, and then they swear off
the platform for good. Well, unsurprisingly the
reason this doesn't work for most people most of the tim e is because this may be the
completely wrong platform for you, for your business. Your people might not even be there, your marketing than what I
call the marketing wasteland an area that is completely
devoid of potential prospects and customers and leads for your business. Much better alternative to
identify your ideal target market, figure out their
demographic details like age, gender, income, occupation, and then match it up with
what social media platforms appeal to that demographic,. Fortunately, this is not secret knowledge. All you have to do is head over to Google and type in social media demographics. So get a long list of different
resources and it'll start linking up men between the
ages of this and this are on this platform and women
between the ages of this and this are on this platform
and this platform appeals to these kind of people,
it changes all the time, but there are a few pretty safe bets. For example, if you're in the business to business community, you're
selling to other businesses, LinkedIn is kind of a staple. If you're serving a demographic
that's 35 or 40 and older, Facebook is still probably your best bet. If on the other hand
most of your customers are 35, 30, 25 perhaps
we're looking at Instagram, TikTok being the new kid
on block does skew younger, but like all social media platforms, all platforms in general, it is aging up and doing
so relatively quickly. So you can find people there,
twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, and it's continuing age up. Twitter still skews slightly younger and a little more urban, Pinterest
still primarily women. YouTube does tend to be
kind of neutral territory for all people looking for all things. There's a kicker that you
need to make video content of course, more on that in a minute. And then of course there's
others that are popular in different countries,
different Reddit forums, different WhatsApp groups, Snapchat. If your demographic is much
younger, lots of options, too many options, that's
why people get confused. See all these options, they think they need to be on all of them. The reality is you're much
better off to choose the one or maybe two different platforms
where your ideal target market is present and active and then go there ignoring everything else. So let's draw our line and move on. So now that we've figured all that out, the next thing that we need to
do is we've gotta figure out what kind of content are we going to make and that leads us to content type. Now what I'm gonna suggest here
is that we need to establish a content type that you're
going to start with. This may ultimately be or
not be where you end up. We're gonna talk about that
more in a minute as well. Lots of cliff hangers and
open loops in this video. So keep watching, the point is though, is that there is a lot to unpack
and where we're gonna start is going to be different
than where we end up because I'm gonna give you
a couple different options, but some are significantly
superior to others. So here's what you've got,
you've got text based content, you've got audio content and
you've got video content. Arguably, you also have some kind of visual graphical content like infographics and visual diagrams and things like that, but typically they're paired
with one of the other kinds of content, you also
have different lengths of content, short form
and long form content. My suggestion is that pretty
much every business out there needs one form of long form
content and then you can do whatever short form content
you like to feed into it. So long form content for
text is obviously a blog. Long form, content for audio is a podcast and long form content for
video would be YouTube. Short form content though we're talking about short tweets, we're
talking about short captions for Instagram, we're talking
about Facebook posts, we're talking about LinkedIn posts, anything like that for text,
audio is a little trickier. We're still kind of looking at mostly podcasts, possibly shorter ones. We're taking clips and adding
video elements to them. And then short form video is
kind of the rage right now. Short form, vertical video. We're looking at Instagram reels, we're looking at YouTube
shorts, we're looking at TikTok. So if you don't mind writing, you can start with text if
you don't mind speaking, you can do audio. And if you don't mind
doing video or getting in front of a camera, finding someone that's
willing to get in front of a camera video is by far
the best one, but again, we'll talk about that in a minute. So we'll get our arrow there
and then let's do our next one, which is mandatory
marketing, no exceptions, every business needs to
use this, it's email. Yeah, I know. Hoping for something a
little sexier myself. But the fact is that email works, it works just as well now if
not better than it ever has before because everybody
uses email, I use email, you use email, your customers,
use email, your doctor, your accountant, your lawyer, everybody that you know
has an email address. Not everybody has a social media account. Not everybody accepts SMS or
text message marketing or even appreciates it, direct mail,
still phenomenally effective, but it's hard to find curated lists, especially for cost effective
prices and it's a slightly more advanced and complicated
marketing strategy that I wouldn't suggest starting out
with, but everybody has email. A bit of a fun fact here, but when I'm working with
a brand new business, I'm doing any kind of consulting or teaching, one of the
very first things I do, if not the first thing I do is take a look at their overall email
marketing strategy strategy. If they don't have a good
one, we'll install one. If they have one that's
working, okay, we'll upgrade it. And I kid you not, every
single time we're able to make substantial and significant
increases in profitability, in customer retention, in
the number of sales made, it's as close to a
magic bullet as we have. So where do you even get started, well, the very first thing you need
is some kind of a lead magnet, also known as a bribe or a
freebie or a content upgrade. Essentially something that you
can give away in exchange for a customer's email address so
that they're actually enticed to join your list. I have an example of this that you can check out
in the descriptions below or by visiting adamErhart.com/cheatsheet. This is my version of a
freebie, of an opt-in guide to get onto the list, alternatively, you can offer your more supportive, more loyal customers and
people that are interested in your business, a way to join your newsletter
directly kind of bypassing the freebie, which does tend to
attract a more loyal subscriber, but your conversion rates
are going to be lower cuz you're not necessarily
offering something of immediate value in return. For an example of this, you can visit adamErhart.com/newsletter, from there, you need to decide
on your email frequency, how often you're going
to be emailing your list, whether it's once a week
or three times a week. Some people email daily,
I've done it in the past. I've kind of found a sweet spot around three to four times a week. Once a week is like your bare minimum. Once every two weeks is
unacceptable, once a month, and I don't even know why
you have an email list. I mean seriously, let's just
run the math for a second. If an email open rate
is say 30% for your list and you're emailing once a month, well, it could be months
before anybody sees you. And then when they
finally do get your email, they've forgotten who you are, so they're likely to A unsubscribe or B, worse mark it is spam and
just delete the whole thing. Also, depending on which
statistic or study you read, marketing via email has been
reported to provide somewhere between a 3800% and 4400%
ROI or return on investment. I don't know if my numbers
are right around there, but they wouldn't be too
far off, it's that good. Long story, short email gotta do it. Okay, moving on to the next one. Essentially, once you've
got some of these pieces in place, it's time to start
putting things together and that comes in the form
of a marketing funnel, also known as a sales funnel, also known as a customer
journey or just a funnel. Aptly named because it
kind of looks like a funnel with a whole bunch of
people coming in at the top and then kind of getting sorted out as they go through the bottom with fewer customers
coming out the bottom. And this is a reminder that most won't. I first heard this from Frank
Kern who said, most won't. In other words, most people won't click, most people won't subscribe,
most people won't buy. And you need to factor
that into your marketing and plan accordingly. This is totally okay because most won't but enough will provided
you do things, right. Now, what a marketing
funnel is really about is mapping out the customer journey, Taking someone who has no idea
who you are and walking them through all of the steps in
order to become a lifelong and loyal customer, a brand ambassador, someone that loves you, loves what you do, wants to tell everyone about
just how great you are, and you are pretty great. Now, the opposite of
having a marketing funnel is just having nothing. I don't know what the
opposite of a funnel would be. Like a like a plate. You just pour stuff on
it splashes everywhere. Sadly, most people have
marketing plates, in other words, they just take all of the
traffic and all of the leads and they just dump 'em somewhere
typically on their homepage, meaning that someone shows up
at your website's homepage, they have no idea what they're doing, they don't know where to go. They might click the contact button, but there's a weird form and
they don't know if they want to do that yet cuz they just met
you and it's kind of pushy. Let's slow down here. So they kind of skirt around a little bit and then they bounce, which is marketer term for
leave and never come back. Again depending on what statistic you use. The vast majority of visitors
to a website that click the back button never return,
somewhere around the range of 98 to 99%. ""Where are they going?"" You might ask. And let me tell you, they're going to your
competitors that actually have a funnel, something that
says, ""Hey, you're new here. Let's start here, let
me give you this thing. Let me nurture you and
provide you some value. Let me follow up, see if
you have any questions, and let me continue
offering you the next step in the process in order
to becoming a customer."" Now, the best advice that I
can offer in a short period of time when it comes to
mapping your marketing funnel is to start at the end
like we did with your goals and then reverse engineer the process, so in other words, for
someone to make a sale, well, what needs to happen before that? Maybe it's visit a sales page, okay, well, what needs to happen
before they visit a sales page? It's like, okay, well
they need to click a link. Okay, well, what needs to
happen for them to click a link? Are they getting it through
content or through email? And then if they got on your email, how are they getting on your email? And essentially you can
just work your way backwards through the process, and then
once it's all mapped out, that's where things get really exciting. Yeah, kind of nerdy about this stuff because once it's mapped out, now you can start looking for gaps, for leaks in your funnel. You can start finding areas
where you're losing people through some random mistake or messaging that just doesn't quite
line up, for example, if everybody's clicking
over to your sales page but nobody's opting in or nobody's buying, well, now we know we
have a conversion issue on the sales page, on the other hand, if people are joining your email list but then never opening any of your emails, well, now we know we have
an issue with congruence between what was promised
and what's being delivered, or perhaps we're just
collecting bad emails. Or if we map it all the way out
and we get to the sales call and we realize that we're only
closing one in four or one in five when we should
be closing one in three or one in two, well now we
know we can start looking at that and we can look at
all of the steps up to it. And was there a congruence issue, again, were there pricing expectations? Were there other
objections and sales issues that we could have overcome
in our marketing prior? What's really cool about this
is that we make a small tweak over here and we increase
conversions by 2% and we increase that one by
3% and that one by 1%, well, it's not like we're adding these things up just one after another, they compound. So an increase by 3% here could lead to 10 or 20 or 30 more sales, which could then lead to
thousands or tens of thousands or even millions more dollars
in revenue at the end. Speaking of revenue, next step here after our funnel is CLV, which stands for Customer Lifetime Value, sometimes referred to as
LTV for Lifetime Value or LCV for Lifetime Customer
Value, whatever it is, it's pretty much all the same thing, which what is the value of a customer to your business over
their lifetime period? Now, some people look at this in revenue, some people
look at it in profit. I typically like to look at it in profit, but it depends on the formula
that we're looking at. The point is, if you've
never done this before, this is an incredibly powerful
exercise to run through to figure out just how valuable
someone is to your business. And I'm willing to bet regardless of what business or market
or industry you're in, it's significantly
higher than you thought, which means that you now have
permission to do significantly more marketing and invest in
significantly more content because you know just how
profitable and how valuable new customers and new
clients and new sales are for your business, so that's step one, figure out what is your CLV, after that, you need to find ways to
encourage and increase retention. The number of clients and
customers that you're going to keep, the length of time
that you're going to keep them, and then finding other ways
to increase that Customer Lifetime Value, either by
selling them more things, by selling them more things more often, by increasing the price, by providing upsells and
down sales and cross sales, essentially other ways
and other opportunities to solve problems that they have. And that's an important
point to make here. What we're doing with our
marketing and with our offers is we're solving problems that they have and when we solve a big enough problem, we're rewarded in direct
proportion to the value of the problem we solve. This is why some people
make a whole lot of money. It's because they solve big
problems and some people struggle to make any money
at all because they're just not solving enough
problems for enough people, or they're not solving big enough problems for enough people, okay, so that is CLV, and what you may notice is
that is kind of the final ring of our concentric
expanding circles, right, moving all the way out,
but we still have one left. And the reason that I
almost didn't want to give it a ring of its own, but rather have it sort
of circle the whole thing is because especially today,
especially now in moving into the future, it's so
important that it almost needs to overlap and encompass
everything else that we're doing. This is going to support all
of the marketing of your offer. It's going to help move you
to towards your goals faster than you ever thought. It's appealing to every target market. More people consume this kind
of content than anything else. Basically checks the box for being able to clearly articulate
miracles and miseries, it works with almost
every single platform, which means we can put
it in front of people and where they're present
and active online, it's the best content type,
we can embed it in email, it works as part of the
funnel, so on and so forth. Probably no surprise
here that the final piece of the puzzle is video. Essentially, the big question that you want to ask yourself here is how can you supercharge
everything you're doing with a video marketing strategy? Now, clearly for long form video. Youtube is the best place
to do it, that said, I appreciate that if you've
never done video marketing before, if you are just getting started, you're not comfortable
in front of a camera. That's a pretty big ask. So we can put that on
the back burner for now, and there are a lot smaller
and somewhat still very effective steps that you
can take leading up to this inevitable conclusion. Number one, start with stories. Grab your phone, look into it, hit record. Go live for like 15 or 30
seconds and share some kind of valuable tip or insight
or story or something that's going on, very low
barrier, no editing required. Raw and authentic will
beat overly produced and polished every single day of the week. If you feel like taking
it up a step further, do more of them once, twice, three, four times even a day
isn't a bad strategy. You can do them on Instagram,
you can do them on Facebook, you can do them on a number of
different platforms as well, depending on subscriber counts and what rules are coming and going. But stories are a great way
to sort of dip your toes into the water and get started. Next If you're willing to take
it that next step further, and you want to capitalize on
all of the available organic reach right now, short
form vertical content is still going to be your best bet. These are things like Instagram reels and TikTok and YouTube shorts. The length of these varies, different platforms
tend to have preferences for different length videos, but typically we're looking
at 15 to 30 seconds, 30 to 60 seconds, somewhere
around that range. So what's something
that you can talk about for 30 to 60 seconds? I'm willing to bet that if you've been in business for any length
of time or you have any sort of passion or interest
in what you're doing, there's a lot of stuff
that you could share that other people would be
interested in hearing about, of course, if you really
want to dominate your space, become the leader in your industry, then YouTube is clearly going
to be the winner here for longform video content, so
don't be afraid to test it out. Upload a few bad videos at first, I mean, the beauty of just getting
started is nobody's really around to watch your stuff, so you get a chance to sort
of practice and experiment a little bit without all the
judgment of the internet. Looking back on my first videos, they were awkward and incredibly sweaty, and I was super nervous and I didn't know how to use a camera,
so it's kind of blurry, and I didn't know how to use a microphone, so it only came outta one side,
yeah, it was, it was rough. But the point is that practice does make progress and you've gotta start somewhere in order to get
better, all that said, there are still seven more
tactics and strategies and tricks and hacks that
I didn't have a chance to get to in this video. So that's why I've linked up
a video right here with seven of the most proven and
effective marketing strategies for you to take a look at right now. So make sure to hop in there and I'll see you in the next video. Understanding the seven things that I'm gonna be walking
you through here today, will allow you to immediately
upgrade all of it, get better results, more
clicks, more traffic, more sales from everything you do."

Futur,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiyNGOIbwcE,if you want to learn the ins and outs of how to make content that attracts the perfect person into your ecosystem whether that's for your business for your product or for just your creative process we're gonna dive deep with Christo on The Fifth Element of his business psychology series attraction marketing you want to stick around for that so let's just jump right into it Chris when you say attraction marketing what exactly do you mean what is it for me attraction marketing is this thing that lives between a couple different principles that you may be aware of one is direct Outreach and sales which is how you do outbound sales strategies and something that's much more ambient which is content marketing which is where you create lots of content and over a long period of time it tracks the right kinds of clients too ideally this is what I would recommend to every single person to build your personal brand new thought leadership your Authority but people don't have that kind of Runway so they need more tangible results so they can't afford to do this for three five seven years so this is some hybrid approach that lives in between more outbound reach and sales approach versus more ambient content marketing personal brand building when we talk about sales and Outreach what are the classic kind of behaviors that you have to do to ensure that you get that kind of result short of cold calling people or cold emailing or cold messaging people the next version of that is something like this and you see this framework being used by a lot of people I do this I help clients with this and if you need help with this talk to me now so it's very clear very transactional it's hyper focused we spoke to Richard Moore recently on LinkedIn on a live LinkedIn audio conversation he teaches people how to do sales using LinkedIn period and the premise was how to go from creating content to getting customers and he's like most of what I do teaches principles around direct sales via social media more specifically on LinkedIn very rarely are you going to see a piece from him about a personal story something emotional that he's going through because he just wants people to know and Associate him with the idea of direct sales strategies using LinkedIn specifically so even while he's making content which we could argue is the inbound marketing that that you said he is using direct sales practices in that content so as soon as you visit his page you're like I know what this man does I know what he sells and either I'm interested or not am I understanding that correctly yeah and it's not even on on his page it's really if you're on LinkedIn one of the strategies he talks about is if anyone is looking at his profile it's a prompt for him to reach out so he's constantly look at who is looking at his profile and saying hey I noticed you're looking at my profile is there anything you need help with and you know this is a very effective sales strategy by the way so if you don't know this you can use the basic LinkedIn function or pay for the more premium version which allows you to see more of who is looking at you and what they're doing this is the premise that Richard works with which is no one's going to look at your profile picture unless they saw something that you did either as a comment to another post or something that you posted and then trying to figure out who you are it's not by random chance it's not like we're scrolling through profiles randomly on LinkedIn so the minute somebody touches it it means that for some reason they're curious they're interested and they want to see who the heck you are it's a great great way for you to turn a lukewarm Person of Interest to something that's much warmer and then on the other side of this coin is what you called content marketing specifically and you said it was a long game help me understand the difference because there was a little bit of content Marketing in that Richard Moore example so how is content marketing different than sales and Outreach that is more outbound based this is more of an inbound strategy which is more of what I do and what many content creators or designer creative types do which is we create stuff sometimes it's visual sometimes it's us demonstrating what it is that we do for example if I like to draw James Barn likes to draw so he does this and he draws logos and he makes funny videos sometimes he dances in them and it just lets people know about what it is that we're doing there's no call to action there's no hard sale there's not even a soft sale and in presenting his work over time you may gain followers and some of those followers might be people who want to buy a logo from him and so then the onus is on them to reach out to James saying hey I love what you do how much is it and I'll give you an example this is real life example right now I was going through my Instagram feed and I'm looking at this typographic animation thing and Instagram knows that I like topography design and animation and I see this thing and it's pretty cool it's an animated typographic poster on a busboard or something and then it's a tutorial on how to create this effect using gradients in After Effects I instantly follow this person and I reach out in their DMs I say hey how much does it cost to make that thing for something I'm looking at this person gave me a price he said three thousand dollars three to four thousand dollars I said the most I have is three K's is something we can do and he's like yes he said we'll send me a proposal let's go he wasn't looking for me as a client per se but by demonstrating what he does his expertise is Art his skill his personality he's able to attract people to you there's no direct correlation between that pose and me seeing it me reaching out I want to just share for the audience the key distinction here is if you are doing sales Outreach behaviors you are inquiring to the end consumer you are going to The Client First when you're doing content marketing if you were strictly doing it because Chris mentioned earlier there's a hybrid approach the audience is inquiring because of all the Goodwill that you've put out there talk to me about what the hybrid approach would look like because like you said earlier not everybody has the bandwidth or the runway to sit there and just make content without ever asking so what would the hybrid approach look like between these two if they were to coexist I think that's what we're going to talk about in terms of what we're planning on doing for the workshop because I realize people don't have the luxury of creating content for the sake of creating content or perhaps they're creating content with a poor strategy to begin with so you could create content for 100 years and get zero zero inquiries for new work we want to fix that I'm a big believer in building thought leadership and building up your personal brand and I'll tell you philosophically where Richard and I disagree and I want to present this so that each person can determine where they live on the Spectrum if you look at our YouTube channel presumably this is where everybody's watching we've created over 1800 videos that's a lot of freaking videos in most of the videos we don't ask for anything we're not trying to get you to sign up for anything and you feel the genuine nature of our generosity and we build a relationship with you Richard's approach is I'm looking for a client I'm looking at the actions that I take that lead to result that I want his whole thing is like I'm here to optimize my work day to generate money or clients for my business so when you do a very targeted approach like this I'm looking for clients you're going to be more successful at hitting those clients and when you're taking a broader approach like myself like I'm going to broadcast content out there because I think I have a idea of who you are and what your struggles are I'm going to hit you I'm gonna hit three of your friends and people I didn't even know I was gonna hit because it's not as targeted so in the short term if we're to bet who is going to win this race you're going to put all your money on Richard I would too because he's going to make more money in the short term but if we step back and say who's going to make more money we should be more valuable who's going to be a key person of influence three five 15 25 years from now it's not so clear of an answer because what we've done is we've built Community we've created value and the thing that you mentioned before is we've created a lot of good will and when you create good will people give you the benefit the doubt they're willing to become I prefer lack of a better term a Super Fan they're on the road to becoming a Super Fan where they'll support you in everything that you do whether you drop a t-shirt a poster where you show up to speak at an event they'll go out and they'll buy tickets because they feel a personal connection to you so one model is more transactional I do something if you need help with this thing I will provide this to you in exchange for your money my model is more transformational it's not transactional I will not see money in a direct correlation between my efforts and what someone gives me on a one-to-one relationship but I believe what I'm doing is building value here's where it gets real interesting people like Conor McGregor Kylie Jenner The Rock have built up a lifetime of either content or Goodwill or relation with someone and then where they cash in is The Rock has a Kila line which is worth a couple hundred million dollars same thing with Conor McGregor proper fifth Irish whiskey so they've been doing something we get to know them we get to like and trust them and eventually when they ask for something you're willing to buy and they're worth so much more I feel like you may have heard him say the word Workshop up he'll be going into a deep dive explanation of all of this across the European tour which will start in April so if you are interested in doing something like that and you've enjoyed these five video series that is something that I would highly encourage you to look in the description on before we go into the hybrid approach Chris the way I understood that is the first one is a strictly sales approach hence the transaction the next one is a brand approach to where at any point once you've given so much Goodwill you could technically sell anything if it aligns with your brand because the audience trusts your brand and the things that you deem worthy of buying my question is what are the things that someone needs to consider when they decide which camp they're in and how they navigate their marketing and I want to be clear that you don't have to pick one or the other you could do both you can actually create content that's actually transactional and create longer term content that's transformational but you start to muddy up the waters a little bit because sometimes you're selling and sometimes you're not and I guess we do some version of that if you are in need of money like you can't eat you can't pay rent you owe money for taxes your partner is going to leave you your children earn Rags you need to focus on building a business and needing a sale you don't have the luxury of the runway that it's going to take to build Goodwill up with your community your audience and potentially some of your customers you got to take care of your business first get your house in order so in that case I'm going to recommend that you go for more direct sales approach more outbound versus an inbound strategy what are some other things for them to decipher if they should go the inbound route aside from they don't need money right now once you have your basic needs taken care of we're not talking about living a life of luxury and having fancy sports cars but you have money for rent for food you can go out on a date you have a little nest egg in case bad things happen your rainy day fun you're good so really what you want to do now you have to think about where do I want to be three five ten years from now and you move into Authority building so this usually is chronological like in terms of how this usually develops but not always is you've got some training whether it's self-taught or you've learned it in a university you're a practitioner the thing that you learn you've been able to do that for a period of time and you might have branched off on your own at this point so we're not talking about someone who's 14 years old trying to build Authority that's a little bit ridiculous so you're maybe in your mid-20s your late 20s early 30s somewhere in there where you start to think about well what's my future like I'm not always going to want to chase clients the way that I do and it's not long-term sustainable so this is now you're in the place where I have things I've learned things that I can share inside I have documentation I have proof of the things I've been able to do it's a good time to start to share that and the way that I would do it is I would start to share that with the younger version of yourself and that's a great way to frame it so we're not thinking about clients we're not thinking about our competitors we're just saying what would the younger version of myself want to know needs to know that could save them a lot of heartache and pain so you start to distill those life lessons down it could be resources whatever it is you're going to speak to this person the reason why I say your younger self is because you know this person already you know their habits you know their resistance you know the way they think about learning sometimes we have a difficult time in writing and creating content because we don't have a clear pictures who the person yeah well this person you know because you spent the most time of your life with this person it's you maybe you could talk about a mentor or a teacher they have yet to meet and what you're learning from this person and you can send it down that timeline if you will and here's the cool part there is some younger version of you out there that is not named you and if it's a big enough audience they'll show up for you and they'll get really excited and they're gonna get pumped up they like your style your tone your delivery your experience your aesthetic and they're going to be hungry for the kind of content that you create I'm so glad that you answered that question the way that you did because I personally struggled in the early stages and only leaning on brand and never asking when I wasn't in a position to only lean on brand and the reason why I asked you that question is because there's a listener out there right now who whether you want to deem it fortunately unfortunately because I love this person as well garyvee who says just give value just give give give give never ask even though he says ask it the third time but it's never really clear when I should ask and then that person who's listening scapegoats Their Fear of selling or their lack of wanting to ask something with well I'm just building my brand you need money you need to build your business you need to make income it's not a bad thing for you to be transactional when you need to survive and you are also giving value to the other person because then if you're only giving value and never getting anything when you actually need something I think Chris and correct me if I'm wrong you can start to feel that that disingenuousness when you're like building a brand but you also want to transact and then it just breeds resentment in the person who's doing that there's a lot that you said there but the part I'm going to zero in on is this part some people mistakenly mix these two strategies they think one they execute like the other give you an example you really want sales your transactional and you're starving but you're playing the long content game but you actually don't behave like that so you're actually not giving value it's a thinly veiled disguise and most people can see right through it yes and I think it's better that you recognize who you are where you're at in your life and be super clear and transparent because you're not fooling anybody you and I follow people and maybe some of them overlap where all they seem to be doing is selling to you all the time and if you need that service if you want that piece of information you're gonna support it you're gonna say I want to reach out to you let's let's do work I'm going to keep following you oftentimes especially I find it with myself that you want to sell and I'm not here to buy anything so I'm gonna unfollow you I'm gonna tune you out for a while I'll check in with you in three six nine months but from this point forward I'm gonna tune you out and that's the danger of wanting to sell to people all the time it's hard to argue against the person who's selling all the time when they're putting a whole lot of money away you're like okay I get it I just have a different relationship with you so let's talk about this model that you've been exploring which we've deemed the hybrid approach where do these two worlds coexist in your in your thinking number one it starts with creating something that's valuable to someone it starts really there and we say like create high value content like what does that even mean well teach me something I didn't know that I haven't already seen a thousand times or share something I know but in a way that I've never seen or deliver in a way that I think is funny interesting here's the example there's a guy who's like hip-hop history I believe where he speaks in language of like yo that cat said this girl or he breaks down movies or plays that are just like pieces of literature that are just hard for the everyday person to understand because the language is funky as heck they're using some like Old English you know and so he takes this he's a he's a African-American and he talks about it I'm like this is super entertaining he's really letting you understand so he's taking a story but he's presenting it to us in a way that's new and novel and different there's a similar concept too it's like drunken history and these are experts and so they loosen up because they're having Libations and they're like oh okay so it's like this and then again to arguments it's kind of funny to watch so first spend the time to identify a resource a tool a guide a study that you produce and package it package in your voice your tone the colors and logos of your company whatever it is that you do and package it up and that's how you can determine if it's a high value piece of content what is the market rate for this piece like what would somebody literally pay to know and if you could say zero then that is worth zero so your target is something about 30 a hundred dollars worth of value that's good enough and some people might then underestimate and say well nothing I do is ever valuable well that's not over correct here we just want to have an honest conversation if you were to ask a neutral friend to look at this thing and say would you pay money for this and how much would you pay and they gave you an honest answer then you know okay so I spent a month and a half designing figuring out something let's just say whatever it is and now I want to share that with people because it's going to help them it's going to make their life easier it's going to get them closer to their goals now I'm not going to just upload a PDF and say download the whole thing I want to build a little Rapport and I want to use social channels to my benefit so what I'll do is I'll extract some of the high value nuggets from this guy this study this report whatever it is I'm gonna write a post about it and I'm gonna say something like for example if you write email copy and you're doing direct sales via email you figured out the 100 subject lines that have the highest open rates and you've run 10 000 campaigns so you have some evidence remember that part about you're in this place in your life where you've done stuff you have proof and evidence okay you can then jump on a platform like LinkedIn and say here are are three subject lines that are guaranteed to outperform anything that you're writing and you would give it to them and you would explain why so you're adding a little more meat on the bones and then you would say something like I've actually just finished writing the top 100 highest performing subject lines over a four year period ten thousand different campaigns tested I'm gonna give it to you for free no strings attached just comment this word below so I know who to give it to so this is the hybrid approach this is also Richard's approach by the way so now I've got something valuable I've created interest the way that you've written it is just super enticing and there's value already delivered to this and so naturally people are very curious like wow these two are so good what did the other 97 look like I want the rest and so now what you've done is you've asked the audience to self-identify I'm a person who writes emails and I'm looking for clients and I need to know what subject lines work if somebody's not interested in that they're not going to read your posts they're not going to engage with you they're definitely not going to comment below whatever the magic phrase is now they've identified and now they're giving you permission to reach out to them quite literally they're saying yo I want the rest of this please so you can say something like hey I just wanted to provide this resource to you thank you for downloading it I'm curious is there a problem that you're trying to solve it doesn't have to be much more complicated than that or out of Interest was there anything that caught your eye what part stood out for you and if it feels like they're aligned with their problem what you can do then you should escalate and you should ask for the next thing and the next thing you're going to ask for is I have three time slots available next week where I spend 25 minutes helping people just like you diagnose their email campaigns it's just of interest to you so you're asking them to make very small commitments where each time they engage you're going to give them increasing amounts of value this is the classic classic structure of permission marketing by Seth Godin so what we're doing in this Modern Age of social media is we're asking for people to volunteer to enroll in a long-term marketing campaign where with each interaction that we go deeper we get increasing amounts of value so first piece of value is here are the three highest performing subject line for email campaigns here is the 97 remaining pieces of value in terms of highest performing subject lines for email campaign and now I would love to give you a diagnostic that's free to you to look at what you're doing to discuss what your goals and challenges are to see if I might be able to solve them then if they agree to that Zoom call or whatever meeting then now you can sit there and diagnose provide more value and at this point you can then tell them at the end of this I'm going to tell you about a way that we can work together only if it feels right to you so you're telling them this is a sales call but not I'm not going to apply any high pressure thing to you I'm just going to park it at the end only if you're interested and then that prospects I I think we need your help what's the plan look like and that's how you go from strangers to friends and friends to customers that's the process that's attraction marketing so if someone were to like yo the hybrid approach I love it I want to do it what should be their first course of action on the thing that they get right before they're like okay I need a I need a free sample I need a funnel I need to be able to convert in the DMs like what do they need to get right first we'll get clear on your audience who is it that you're marketing to do they have an urgent desire to solve a very uncomfortable pain point do they have the means to be able to buy a solution to them they don't have the means it's not any good so you can solve a problem for someone but they can't afford the solution it's not going to really work so for example if somebody is in like a lower income bracket and needs to go from point A to point B to go to work but they're on a place where they have great credit or they have a down payment or they're even contemplating buying a car they don't really care how sophisticated your funnel your marketing campaign is they just can't buy a car really what you should do is be solving other kinds of transportation problems for them maybe a month-long pass that allows them to take any form of public transportation you should be focused on that or what many industrial designers and urban planning people are trying to figure out is something called The Last Mile so we can take public transportation but it's that last mile that kills us where we have to walk somewhere to work or park to a restaurant so they make electric scooters they make all kinds of devices to get you past that Last Mile and that's what they're focused on because we're not going to inherently change the infrastructure of public transportation but we can make easier for you from the stop in which you get off at to where you need to be so that's where they need to focus their energy the energy that you need to focus for the hybrid approach of Attraction marketing to work is watch the last four videos so you can dial in your attraction marketing for it to be effective I do have one last question and then I'll leave you to take it wherever you want to take it what do you think people get wrong when trying to execute this hybrid approach that you are seeing often and you think people should avoid making this mistake I don't see so many people taking the hybrid approach we know many people on the one side of the spectrum or the other where they're really about building quote-unquote brand or they're just doing all sales all the time we don't see a lot of sophisticated things in the middle because the thing in the middle is very difficult because not only do you have to understand how to do direct sales but you also have to know how to make content that attracts people to you that's a fact that it's going to be valuable so they're going to be inherently fewer people could do that because a they're not aware and B it's not easy so I don't really have an easy answer for you there no I think think that answer was sufficient it is probably still not as long of a game as strictly building brand when you need money but it is a sophisticated game that will be challenging at first but when you can Master it the upside is crazy I mean look at Chris maybe the word is not master but you have done an exceptional job in doing that okay gang that is the end of the five part series of the five core Essentials to grow your business as a creative freelancer if you've enjoyed this series you can go back to the last four videos binge them as many times as you want ask questions in the comments but I did want to leave some time at the end of this video if you've gotten value and are still here with us for Chris to just say a few words about the European tour that's coming up for him to teach these principles very very in-depth and for you to get as much value as possible so if you're still here check that out and we'll see you in the next video well first of all I want to say thank you thanks for making all the way to end we know there's a high drop off rate and the fact that you're still here says a lot to me about who you are and that you're connecting to the content what a lot of people don't realize about me where I came from is before I made a YouTube video I taught at private art schools for 15 years before I taught at a private art school I ran a business for even longer period of time so I was running a successful motion design business for five years prior to even thinking about teaching what I've come to realize about myself is my identity I thought was for a very long time a service provider one who makes commercials graphic design visual things for people but I was suppressing a deeper identity which was one of an educator so when people used to ask me who are you Chris I'm a designer I'm a designer I would say that everywhere I would go I took great pride in that but today when people ask me what are you what do you do I don't pause so much anymore I just say I'm a teacher that's connected to who I am over the last two and a half years it's been very difficult not on us but on every single person on the planet because of covid and recently when I went out and I was teaching again in person I kind of reignited a passion inside of me that made me feel so alive and so when I was in doing a tour a workshop tour in Australia I felt more alive than I've been in a long time you hear me say things like my brain was on fire and I live to grow so when I'm out there teaching there was a quote here I was interviewed recently and I was like I really like this here we go Craig Philip told me this he's like you teach for yourself that you practice for your students I say to them I think there's this dichotomy with teaching that it's simultaneously a selfish act and an act of generosity so when I teach I'm sharing my goods if you will to to the people or the person is in front of me right I'm sharing it with you like here are tools here's our ideas here's a big reframe or here's how you would phrase this so that you have to deal with this friction Point anymore but in doing so what the person who's asking the question is unaware of this they're extracting or inducing something from me which is a piece of information I didn't even know I had and in doing so I learned something about myself and when you're I slide up I'm like wow okay I have another way of explaining that to you and here's the cool part of like live teaching which is one person will say something and they accept your answer but another person's like uh wait a minute I don't accept it how about this Chris how about this how about this and you're getting hit from three different angles so you'll have a much clearer picture as to what's not working so you explain it slightly different ways or in a whole different way it's a very long way of saying something so I feel most alive when I'm teaching people in person and so we decided to try a concept we're not an event production company but if I was really filled with joy and delight and my creative Soul was fulfilled in Australia why wouldn't we try this more often in more places so we're like let's go to Europe let's run some workshops and I don't want these artificial time constraints to be put on us I want to do a full eight hours of teaching on two different subjects versus smashing everything I know together in four hours or even 30 minutes so we're trying a theory we're gonna go to Europe we're gonna be there in April and we're gonna hit seven different cities tickets are selling out really fast now so we're gonna probably announce that we're sold out in London and Berlin pretty soon because I keep seeing a steady stream of tickets I hope to be able to see you there I feel deep inside my heart that if you're willing to show up and put in your best effort well I teach you will be transformational there's the transaction that's happening you have to buy a ticket but the transformation that you receive will far exceed the mountain you pay so we'll see you in Europe is that right ciao all right

eIcwB1fE6ko,The Ultimate Social Media Strategy For Fashion Design,Unknown,2911,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eIcwB1fE6ko/hq720.jpg,2022-07-31 00:00:00,698,FittDesign Studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIcwB1fE6ko,what's up design family welcome back to another episode of fit design tv so glad to have you guys back on the channel on today's episode we have a social media content strategy guide for you guys specifically you fashion brands that are looking to take your social media content to the next level ultimately you should be having three key goals when it comes to any sort of content and engagement that you create number one you want to drive awareness to your brand you want people to know about you who are you what is your story second you want to help to depth in and create more depth to your brand at the end of the day what is going to separate you from brands xyz is going to be that look and feel and your social content is the fundamental place that you need to start building that aesthetic and then lastly you need to be able to actually drive traffic towards your point of sales where you're actually going to have your customers convert from being loyal fans and consumers of your content into actual consumers of your products there's no point in creating a beautiful brand and creating a lovely aesthetic only to have people not be able to find out where you live or ultimately where they can actually buy your products from it's important to be able to convert that loyal customer base into a loyal actual paying customer base so if you're interested in terms of what my key tips are as a creative director and as a designer who's worked with over 1 000 brands well watch this video you're going to find out what's up design family and welcome to fit design tv so glad to have you here on this channel we discuss all things sports fashion graphic design manufacturing and technology we'll discuss key topics answer pressing questions and provide actionable steps on starting your own product line if you're interested in any of the above topics stick around you're in for a good one [Music] our core goals with any social media content strategy is three key things number one we want to drive more awareness then we want to bring in more traffic and ultimately we want to have more conversion so the first fundamental step that you need to decide on is figure out where your customers actually live the beautiful thing about fashion is that there's a fashion brand for pretty much everyone whether you're into a specific type of fashion genre whether it's high fashion whether it's ready to wear whether it's affordable fashion whether it's sustainable fashion there's a brand out there for you but because there's different niches different industries there's going to be different areas where your customers are going to live a typical or an older customer base is not going to spend their time consuming content in these same spaces as a younger generation so figure out who your target customer is have immense clarity over where they live where they spend most of their time where they browse what type of content interests them right you need to be specific in terms of writing this stuff out and having a clear idea of my customer base their likes their dislikes their income range where they're spending most of their time specifically on social media is it tick tock is it instagram is it on facebook is it on linkedin well having clarity over that is going to direct you towards where you should be spending your time where you should be spending your efforts and ultimately how you should be engaging with your audience because engaging on facebook is going to be extremely different than engaging on twitter the medium is the message here so understanding that and understanding how to tailor your content for the channel you're picking is going to be key number two always always make sure to post content that accurately represents your brand start off with understanding what your brand identity is what is the look and feel of your brand a brand that's focused on sustainable activewear is going to look fundamentally different than a purely crossfit or gym performance brand that distinction is going to be key because the look and feel and the aesthetic of your posts is going to be heavily dictated by that branding strategy when it comes to what you should post or how you should post well a lot of people get stuck in this either i see them try to emulate brands that they look up to and ultimately their feed just looks like a watered down version of very famous brands feeds or they end up not posting at all so having that clarity is going to be key at the same time not all content that you post on your page needs to be original content you can sort of treat your online profiles as a mood board of sorts it's very easy to sort of tailor your strategy or your feed with a mix of originally created content and images that represent your brand aesthetic for it to be on brand this is where the initial step of understanding your brand look and feel comes into play mixing and matching original content with posts that you're finding from other creators of course feel free to tag them feel free to share and mixing and matching those aesthetics is a great place to start as you build momentum as you bring in the resources in-house to actually consistently create content from there you can begin to only post original content so don't be scared to mix and match don't be scared to experiment don't be scared to sort of create a mood word of sorts that tells your story in a way that's concise and cohesive number three always make sure to vary your content you don't want to get onto the same track where you're consistently posting the same content people get bored easily so always refreshing your content strategy always giving your customers and your viewers something new to look forward to is going to be key when it comes to types of content there's honestly three key types of content that you always want to consider look at these as archetypes the first one is going to be the content that you need to grow essentially the content that you need to get in front of as many eyeballs as possible the second is going to be the content you need to actually sell to convert to get people to buy from you and lastly it's going to be the content you need to build your brand to provide depth to let people know more about your story to get them invested into you trying to focus on any one of these three more than the others okay not having a balance ultimately is going to create an imbalance in terms of your content strategy right if you try to sell too much you honestly come off as too pushy you come off as too salesy and that can turn people off the same time if you only post content to grow well you're not creating a strong brand identity and if you're only posting a brand identity well people are not gonna find you because you're not having that appeal or that sort of distribution that you need to actually get people to come to you so focus on building your brand strategy focus on building what it means to be brand xyz and create content that can satisfy those three key categories number four in order to avoid posting paralysis this is basically where you haven't posted for a couple of days and you find yourself in this sort of state of well i don't know what to post and i haven't posted in a while so the first post needs to be amazing but i don't have an amazing post you need to actually schedule your posts ahead of time and you can do this in a variety of ways either you can actually work with an app something like later.com which is essentially a dashboard and it'll give you a calendar view and you can actually schedule ahead posts on a ton of different platforms whether it's facebook instagram ticktalk pinterest you can create your posts ahead of time and scheduling them out you can even write the captions you can provide the hashtags you can make your tags and when the time is ready to post it'll ping you on your phone and it'll tell you hey your post is ready do you want to publish it this is a great way to just get ahead of the curve and actually create a sense of consistency with your posting you never want to be that brand where you're not posting for a month and then all of a sudden in the same two days you're posting a thousand different posts right that inconsistency is just extremely unprofessional you want to be slow and steady in your approach but consistency here is going to help you win the race and help you stand the test of time so consider bringing in an app if you need to right if you're on your own you don't have a social media manager bring an app to help you schedule your posts out in advance and that's going to go a long way towards establishing and maintaining consistency last but not least definitely consider creating a social media calendar so what is a social media counter at the beginning of every month it's very important to plot out what your social content looks for that month have some specific themes that you want to follow have specific sales goals that you want to hit have specific campaigns that you want to have by having a calendar you're thinking ahead and also what i love about a calendar is you begin to think holistically as opposed to thinking per post you're thinking in a more holistic process which really allows you to weave together campaigns which allows you to link together different ideas which again allows you to create those three different archetypes of posts where you're building your brand you're making your sales and you're achieving awareness this is so important and it's only when you have a calendar that you can you that you're able to have that oversight over everything you're able to see okay i have way too many posts where i'm trying to sell so maybe i should pull back a little bit on this and maybe i should create some more content that is meant to build the brand at the same time having a calendar allows you to be seasonal whether it's the christmas season or whether it's the end of year or whether it's any specific time where it would be beneficial for you to post a specific type of content well a calendar is going to allow you to get ahead of the curve and actually create that content ahead of time and post it so you have it when it's ready and you can create a campaign that's robust and actually achieves the goals that you need to so make sure you're creating a content calendar get creative look to other brands for inspiration but do the work do the due diligence and i promise you this is going to set you ahead of 99 of brands out there well guys that is it that is a wrap on this episode that's been my ultimate social media content strategy guide for fashion brands to recap quickly there's five key things that i need you guys to follow number one actually find out where your audience lives right if you know where they live then you know where to distribute your actual content two post content that represents your brand and have a sort of mood board-esque look and feel to your brand if you don't have the content up front mix and match with existing types of content that match your brand vision and your brand aesthetic three make sure to vary your content hit the three key types of content that we mentioned content that's meant to sell content it's meant to bring your brand awareness and ultimately content that's meant to build the brand four schedule ahead and be consistent consistency is going to be key towards longevity for your

you watch the end of this video I'm going to give you an exclusive look at my content calendar for January so you can see exactly how I'm putting my Instagram strategy for 2024 into practice but in the meantime I really want to walk you through what I see as the most important aspects of any successful Instagram strategy going into 2024 so welcome back my friends to my yearly tradition of exposing my Instagram strategy for you so that you can see the strategy and the reasoning that goes into how and what I post and hopefully it'll share some insight that you can apply to your own Instagram content to help you grow a bit faster this year 2023 was my biggest year for Instagram growth yet I started with about 35,000 followers in January and by the end of the year I had over a 100,000 however I'm not just going to replicate the same strategy that helped me Triple my follower growth in 2023 instead I'm going to modify it to make it even more effective for this year and also ensure that it preserves some level of work life balance cuz that's really important too okay let's talk about it I'm sure it won't surprise you to learn that reals was the most significant factor contributing to my growth on Instagram in 2023 my typical posting schedule was three sometimes five reels per week posted Monday through Friday and I was honestly just generating ideas week by week kind of making my reels on the Fly I did eventually land on a bit of a weekly content creation schedule where on like Tuesday I would script them Wednesday I would film them Thursday I would edit them and schedule them for the following week but if I'm honest it was a bit of a scramble it was a little bit chaotic and I wasn't always the most consistent cuz I had to take breaks here and there cuz I couldn't keep up with it now obviously posting that often was very beneficial to my growth but I know it's not sustainable in the long term especially with the other goals that I have for content in 2024 and especially with just doing it week by week and not planning ahead at all so even though obviously it worked very well for me I'm modifying to try to take advantage of the benefits that I saw in myat stry last year but make it more sustainable for me to keep up for the rest of this year so here's what I'm going to do I am planning on posting three reels per week Monday Wednesday and Friday uploading them at 9:00 a.m. eastern though the timing of it doesn't really matter that's just for the sake of my own planning and consistency one of those reels is going to be an original reel and the other two are going to be trendy I'm going to plan my content ideas on a monthly basis and kind of start to script out what those original reels are going to look like but I'm not going to actually create them until the week before I want to post them this will help lighten the load of my weekly workflow so I don't have to come up with ideas on the fly but it will make it not so overwhelming to try to batch them a month in advance and it'll also allow me to select audios that are trending at the moment when I want to post so I'm kind of taking the Real's creative process and breaking it out into what I can plan in advance and what needs to be done in a more timely fashion just to spread it out and make it less overwhelming okay so let's talk about trendy versus original reels cuz I think this is a really important distinction that will help you craft a strategy that's most effective to work towards your goals a lot of us when we think about Instagram reels immediately what comes to mind is the trendy reels so really short videos that are probably like 5 to 7 Seconds long utilizing a trending audio lots of visuals and text on screen not going to lie these reels perform really well this is the kind of thing that will go viral the most easily and they also have the benefit of being pretty easy to make once you collect a nice vertical b-roll library for yourself which I recommend basically continuously filming your life here and there when you have a spare moment so that you can build up this library of content and then you can just remix the b-roll that you've collected into different formats with different Audi and different text on top so not only are these easy to make but they also tend to get you a lot of reach now you might be thinking okay Katie if you're saying trendy reels are easier to make and they get me more views why would would I ever make original reels then and it's true some people approach Instagram reels that way and they can grow very quickly but I see the limitation being community and like authentic connection because the thing is I honestly do follow some accounts that basically just crank out a trendy reel every single day and they're kind of recycling the same six or seven clips that they have with different audios and different kind of text prompts and yeah they get millions of views but I can only imagine that I'm not the only one who's noticed that they're just recycling the same Clips again and again and so the danger with only ever doing trendy reels is that you're going to end up kind of boring your audience or maybe never really having a core community of people that sincerely care about you cuz the thing about trendy content is the stuff that's going to perform the best is the stuff that almost feels the most Anonymous that feels like anybody could insert themselves into your b-roll or into your scenario and feel like it relates directly to them which means you're never going to be able to fully Infuse your own personality in that if it becomes too Niche or too specific to you then it doesn't really work in that trendy format and so that's why I think it's so important to incorporate original reals because it helps to nurture that relationship with your actual community and audience instead of just kind of pandering to the algorithm and trying to get as many views as possible cuz yeah views are important and reach is important but what's more important is actual human beings that know who you are are connected to what you're sharing and we'll click on your links and buy your offers and whatever and just creating the most trendy sort of generic content for the algorithm isn't going to result in a strong community so that's why original reels are important and if you haven't heard me talk about them before what I mean by original reels is almost like mini YouTube videos these are the type of reals where you're may be speaking directly to the camera or filming a bit of a vlog maybe it's a tutorial or maybe it's a story time but the point is it doesn't rely on a trending audio to make sense it's probably not going to just be a collection of b-roll with text you'll probably actually hear your voice in it and it'll likely be longer a lot of the original reels that I make are the full 90 seconds we'll get into this more in detail when I show you my content calendar cuz I think it'll be easier to explain with examples but the main takeaway is when you're planning a real strategy it's really important that you target not only reach and growth but also sustaining that connection with your community now if you want to learn to edit your reels or design beautiful reels cover or write captivating captions you should definitely check out the sponsor of

okay I'm going to be honest with you I feel like carousels and feed posts in general really anything that's not real has been sadly neglected by my Instagram strategy in this last year I really have been so focused on reals because that's where I see the most reach and growth which I think it makes sense for your effort to be proportionate to where you're seeing results however I feel like there are a lot of benefits to carousels and feed content that a lot of people are forgetting about right now in this moment where we're so obsessed with reals specifically I've just really realized more recently the importance of that Community Connection honestly I've been feeling a little disconnected from the people that are following me on Instagram which is why I started my broadcast channel and I'm trying to be more intentional about connecting over DMS and in the comments and I think this is a really common thing with a lot of creators like the primary struggle of being a content creator is trying to get strangers on the internet to be invested in and care about your everyday life which is a big feat and I think one of the ways that you can take the audience that you have gathered through reals which have gained you a lot of reach a lot of new followers and then convert that into an audience that's actually more like a community who not only cares about you and what you have to share but also is connected with each other I think one of the best ways to do that is through more personal Carousel style content so here's why I think carousels in particular are so good at connecting with your community okay so for one when I'm talking about carousels I mostly mean like Photo dumps I really think photo dumps are kind of an underutilized Style for a lot of creators like yes there's many influencers that are doing that all the time but a lot of us who are so focused on reals and reaching new people forget that we can share little moments of our personal lives with our followers and I think you can do that through very casual photos of your life mostly this content is going to show up in the feeds of your existing followers and that's okay I think it's important that you don't judge carousels by your real standards because it's for a different purpose it's going to have a different result and I think you want to focus on trying to generate convers ation in the comments asking your followers to share highlights from their week as well so my plan going into 2024 is to include like one little Carousel photo dump per week I'd really like to share a little behind the scenes moments maybe like a photo of like my coffee on my desk or my filming setup cuz I think it just gives a little bit more insight into what my life looks like and it gives me a chance to connect more closely with my like most immediate community members in the comment section now of course you can approach carousels in a different way like if you want to make make graphic carousels that are meant to be shared or if you want to share memes or like really artistic images that are going to show up on the explore page you can definitely think about it that way in my personal Instagram strategy though I'm thinking about carousels as a way to connect with my community so like I mentioned community building is going to be a big part of my strategy for this year and that is taking form in this recent addition to my Instagram portfolio and that is my broadcast channel Instagram introduced broadcast channels back in February of 2023 but I just topped on the bandwagon in November if you're not familiar it's essentially like a private Twitter feed but it's kind of in the format of like a DM conversation however you're the only one that can put messages into that conversation but there's some really great interactive features like polls question boxes and when you put something into this chat your members will receive that notification in their DM inbox you can send text audio notes videos I'm really excited about this part of my Instagram strategy because it's already given me the opportunity to share stuff that I feel like isn't good enough for stories or the feed honestly I can admit that I've gotten really caught up in trying to optimize my Instagram stories for the most reach possible and I think the reality is when you're a full-time Creator anything that could potentially be monetized like for example doing brand deals on your stories you're going to get kind of fixated on what your numbers look like cuz you want to make sure that you have good stats to show your Brands and like aside from that it's just it's really easy to to kind of fixate on numbers and want to see them get higher but for some reason with the broadcast channel knowing that it's a limited number of people that are even going to join in the first place I don't stress so much about how many of those people have actually opened up the message and seen what I sent and so it gives me this freedom to share more behind the scenes stuff and gather more feedback from my most engaged audience members so I'll send stuff like different thumbnail Options For an upcoming YouTube video and get people to vote on which one they think is better but also more personal stuff like little video updates about what's going on in my life I think broadcast channels are an amazing way to Foster that deeper connection with your most connected community members and not stress so much about the metrics and it's just a really powerful way to directly connect with your followers because it kind of cuts through all of like the fog of the algorithm goes straight to their DM inbox so they're kind of more likely to see it once they actually join okay so what's my actual strategy well I'm going to aim to share something in my broadcast channel maybe every weekday maybe a little less often than that I definitely don't want to start posting stuff in there more than once a day cuz I'm afraid it'll get annoying I think I want to try doing some Q&A sessions and also just sending little life updates here and there but overall I'm not going to overly strategize or overly optimize on this I kind of just want to go on Vibes for the broadcast channel because it is about that authentic connection so I would advise if you're starting a broadcast channel as well don't stress out over having to do something like every day or every week or whatever just share stuff when you feel like it the same way that you would in your like friend group chat or whatever and I think that'll come across better to the audience anyway speaking of community if you made it this far to the video I just want to stop and sincerely thank you for being here I was in kind of a nostalgic and reflective mood making this video because I was looking back on my past Instagram strategy exposed in previous years and just thinking about how much my YouTube channel has changed since then how far it's come and how I've been able to incorporate I feel like more of my personality and more lifestyle pieces here and there which is what I've always wanted to do so thank you so much for sticking around for yet another year yet another Instagram strategy exposed and I just really really appreciate your support on my YouTube channel all right moving on to Instagram stories I have experimented a lot in the past year with my Instagram stories to try to figure out what works the best for a while I tried posting every single day several times a day like probably like 9 to 10 different story slides by the end of the day and then I tried posting like twice per week if you want to see the full multi-week experiment where I take you through my methodology and the results you can check that out up here but I'm just going to tell you what I landed on and what I'm taking with me into 2024 as my Instagram strategy moving forward I personally found that posting every single day on my stories led to quite low reach I kind of think that I honestly just don't have enough interesting stuff or good visuals to share that frequently I have found the most success with with posting three times per week so on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays this gets me the best views and what it really comes down to is my story is able to fully expire have its full 24-hour lifespan before I post the next one because the reality is if you're posting every single day people are always going to see your oldest story first right if I tap on your story I'm going to see the first one you posted that still hasn't expired yet and so if I post some stories on Monday that are kind of like me not that exciting and then I start posting again right away on Tuesday even if my Tuesday content is really good people are going to have to tap through the Monday stuff to see it and so that's why if you post every single day throughout the week you're going to just see your views continue to drop because people have to tap through the previous stuff before they can see the newer stuff which may be better and more engaging but they're just not going to see it if they have to tap through your older content first so that's why I think every story gets its best opportunity for higher reach if you let your older stories expire first let's take a look at the analytics shall we because I really have been tracking this quite closely and I've been tracking my stats month by month so I can kind of see how things have shifted as I've tried these different strategies thankfully things have been steadily increasing since August when I did this big experiment and then I kind of shifted my Approach back in August the average reach for my stories was 2651 this is also when I posted the most story frames at 65 in September you can see I posted less often only 48 story frames and my average reach was 2700 so we're getting a little bit higher in October I posted even less only 33 story frames and my average reach was 3,900 so pretty big increase there and in November even less story frames at 19 and my average reach was 4600 I really think that things have increased for me because I've been taking more of a quality over quantity approach now what I will say is in my experiment I did find posting more frequently got you less views per story but it got you more like Impressions overall because you have that many more story frames right so it's kind of like the same like a thousand people or whatever were seeing all of my stories so they were seeing me a lot but with my posting less frequently approach I'm getting a wider group of people seeing me less often so I will admit it kind of depends on what your goal is if you really want to strengthen the bond with your most close community members posting more often on your story might be a good approach but if you want to expand your reach and kind of reach a wider swath of your existing audience then posting less frequently but with higher quality stories might be the better approach for you and I'll will also be honest that if I was able to maintain the average story views that I saw when I posted less often and and still post more frequently I probably would do that like in an Ideal World I'd be getting 5,000 story views every single day and posting multiple times per day so I think that's something that I might experiment with or try to work towards this year is seeing if I can like get that reach up and then maintain it but so far I found that difficult if I'm honest while we're on the topic of stories I wanted to talk about some of the trends that I've seen shifting in what seems to perform well on stories or what you see a lot of on stories these days now of course this is always going to be different audio Audience by audience but I've seen really strong indicators at least in the people following me of what kind of does well and what is not so great anymore first big one talking to camera just long videos several frames in a row of you speaking to the camera even with captions it's not engaging enough it doesn't perform well it's so much slower paced than say a real where you've actually edited out your pauses and stuff and for a lot of people who are watching without audio they just have to like wait a long time for those captions to flip over something new like it probably would be preferable to just read it all it'd be faster okay this is an interesting one wide angle selfies used to be my absolute Surefire way to start off the week right and get a lot of views that isn't so much the case for me anymore which is kind of a breath of fresh air because I always felt like my first photo needed to be a selfie in order to get like any reach but I've actually found that kind of aesthetic environmental photos seem to be doing really well for me whether it's a photo of like my podcast set or just like my van in the Morning Light these have been some of my better performing stories lately and in general I think this is a trend because a lot of the story content that I see it's kind of like topping through a Pinterest board which I kind of like another big thing I've noticed is that less text is better I think that in the past I've been really tempted to provide just a ton of context and write like paragraphs and paragraphs on top of photos and not only does that not look very nice but also most people don't have the patience to read it all so I find that the best mix is a photo with just a little bit of text that is like eye capturing because it's a beautiful photo but it also kind of sustains that attention a little bit longer with some added text finally by far the worst reach I saw this entire past year on my stories is when I shared a real or a feed post it's funny because you'd think oh this is a great opportunity for me to try to get more traffic to my reel no it's not going to work because your story views are going to be like less than half of what they they normally are and most of those people are not actually going to tap and go watch that real that you shared so my plan for 2024 I'm going to continue with that Monday Wednesday Friday every 48 Hours posting on stories plan cuz that's worked really well for me but my goal is to try to intentionally share more links which I know might sound funny but like I am like the worst at promoting myself and I want to try to share affiliate links links to my offers and just actually take advantage of all of this reach that I'm generating like I'm trying so hard to have higher story views and for what right like I actually need to use that to further my business in some way so that's my goal for the New Year all right we have made it to that part of the video friends I'm going to walk you through my actual content calendar so you can see how this all fits together okay so this is my content calendar I have it all set up in notion I'm a notion girly through and through this is my calendar for January as you can see I have a couple different formats of content here on Tuesdays I have my YouTube videos all in various states of production and on Monday Wednesday and Friday we have my reals content so like I was saying before I plan out the concepts a month in advance and then I'm going to create the content a week at a time just to make it more attainable I kind of mix it up though Mondays tends to be my original content day and Wednesdays and Fridays are my trendy content day though not every week is like that now I know a really common question around watching and planning your content calendar is like how do you plan trending content when you don't know what the trends are going to be yet and I'm going to tell you how I do that the thing about Instagram reals Trends is like honestly they're so formulaic at this point it really doesn't matter what the audio is because the same kind of format is used again and again it's very quick cuts on aesthetic b-roll with some kind of text over top of it with a different audio that gives a different vibe and then you just kind of match the text with the audio that has the right Vibe okay like for example I've planned this one for Friday the 19th I think I found the perfect tripod for creators so this reel is literally just going to be vertical footage of me unboxing my new tripod for my phone it's going to be Quick Cuts and the text on top is going to say I think I found the perfect tripod for creators and then halfway through the video I'm going to have product details and caption show up on screen I don't know what the audio is going to be for this yet but I'm going to wait and see whatever happens to be the trending audio at the time so that's what a lot of these reels look like and another example POV you're creating your vision board for 2024 same kind of vibe it's going to just be cute clips of me making my vision board and then I'll pair that with an audio that's trending now for my original reels I can plan more stuff in advance like for example how to film high quality videos for Instagram so I'm going to go through and talk about the settings that I would recommend that you change on your phone so I'm going to actually be talking to the camera to explain this so that is really what my content calendar looks like I'm going to try to add my Carousel posts in there like I was saying I don't have those planned out necessarily because I'm going to see what content I have at the time but I'm going to aim for posting those on Thursdays and like I mentioned my broadcast channel I don't have that planned out specifically cuz I'm going to try to do it based on Vibes if creating a content calendar like this for Instagram feels overwhelming to you I did want to let you know that my agency Creator Lee media is currently accepting new clients for Instagram content creation so you have two options we can either build out your Instagram strategy for you and then you can run with it and create your own content or we can create your Instagram strategy and create your content you can check out all the details about that at the link in the description or just go to Creator media.com where you can see our services and apply to become a client cuz we'd love to work with you oh and one last not on the content calendar if you're curious yes I do try to repurpose as many of these as possible as Tik toks and I'm thinking about doing them as shorts as well and that my friends is my Instagram strategy for 2024 exposed I hope you found this helpful I hope it can inform your Instagram content creation Journey this year and of course if you want to see this content strategy in action then you should definitely go follow me at Katie steckley on Instagram I feel like I have a very full Instagram journey ahead of me for this year because of course I've got my at Katy steckley my main page where I'm going to be sharing content with youall but I'm also Reviving my Creator Club podcast Instagram and I'm also posting on my van life Instagram Katie and Dan and a van so stay tuned to see how that goes you can let me know in the comments if you'd want to see a video about like balancing multiple different brands and how I kind of keep it straight in my mind and I'm still figuring it out but I could take you along for the journey now if you want more insight into why the Instagram story strategy that I'm implementing works and how I know it works you should check this video my little mad scientist experiment where I painstakingly collected data to figure out what the best way to post on Instagram stories for maximum reach is so check that video out next and as always thank you so much for watching thank you for being here for another year I hope you're having adventures and following your dreams and I'll catch you in the next video bye"

00:00:00,1802,Simplilearn,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrGSKnShmk,welcome to the lesson on brand strategy in this lesson we will look at what the brand strategy fundamentals are and what distinguishes companies who approaches branding as an asset versus those who consider branding as a product since we're focused on digital we will explore how it revolutionized some aspects of branding and lastly we will spend some time looking at building brands for startups small businesses or multi-brand global organizations by the end of this lesson you'll be able to describe the role of the values vision mission objectives and promises in defining your brand explain how defining your brand as an asset or as a product will impact everything afterward discuss how digital is impacting brands and the role of the brand manager analyze how brand marketing might differ from various types of organization brand values first let's demystify what a brand strategy is and isn't your brand is not your product logo website or name in fact your brand is much more than that it's more intangible it's the hard to pin down feeling that separates powerhouses and mediocre brands from each other we can present the concept of branding as a hierarchy first the values of your organization are the ultimate aspirational principles you stand for from a brand marketing perspective it is the starting point on which you perform this work the fundamental motivation for your decisions even if the world keeps changing around you your brand core values tend to remain very constant seth god and the best-selling author wrote a brand's value is merely the sum total of how much extra people will pay or how often they choose the expectations memories stories and relationships of one run over the alternatives the opposite would be a commodity an item with little or no perceived brand value and you probably don't want that because it would mean people are not seeking it out if people relate to your brand values they might be willing to pay a premium next comes the vision what do you ask for to achieve where do you want to go it represents the hopes and ambitions when microsoft revisited its global image in 1994 its tagline was where do you want to go today the branding campaign had microsoft spending 100 million through july 1995 of which 25 million was spent during the holiday shopping season the values and the vision leads to your mission at this point things becomes achievable this is what you want to do and who you want to do it with be it employees or partners maybe now you have a motivation and a purpose then it's time to get strategic and define good objectives that everyone can rally around those objectives paves the way for how you are going to make things happen good objectives will help you plan prioritize and most importantly communicate what you want to do the last and lowest level of the pyramid becomes very specific and tangible it describes specifically what you have to do and the key performance indicators kpis for short will let you know how you are progressing toward defined objectives while the winning condition of the previous point was communication this one is all about typical project management tasks actions who will own them when they will be done what kind of resources are required and what should you expect once the tasks are and actions are completed brand vision behind every successful business is one important ingredient an effective brand and behind every brand is a story built upon a strong vision to create a brand you'll need two important elements a brand mission and a brand vision while a mission tells your investors team and audience where your company is focusing today a vision tells the most important people around you where you're going tomorrow it highlights where you hope to find yourself in the future mark lipton the author of guiding growth how vision keeps companies on course doesn't believe in a vision statement he argues that management inevitably gets too dependent on a piece of paper hung up on conference room walls it is far more important that all managers talk to people about the vision in their own way using their own language you don't want to have a vision statement that is too constrained it should describe why the organization is doing what it does it should be a challenging and far-reaching purpose the vision needs to address three interdependent core topics a mission statement presenting the organization's purpose the reasons for being and a claim to be able to solve something for its customers a strategy explaining how the mission will be achieved and values the beliefs attitudes assumptions embraced on a daily basis through all the activities necessary to move the needle through the strategy closer to the mission and ultimately the vision brand mission a vision statement describes where the company aspires to be a mission statement is more tangible and a more action-oriented version of the vision statement it states clearly the purpose the organization serves for its audience a good mission statement is inspiring transformational and often as a touch of surprise of course you'll want your mission statement to be closely aligned with your corporate values and culture and serves as an anchor to guide actions now and into the future tesla is a good example we all associate the name with fancy electric cars and you might not even know where the name originated from nikola tesla is the engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating current electric system but tesla's mission isn't just about creating cool self-driving cars the whole company is about putting the environment first by creating innovative solutions using electricity so this includes cars of course but also solar panels and clean energy storage brand objectives the objectives describes a set of decisions to reach short to mid-term goals a strategy is put into practice by splitting it up into specific actions and tasks to be carried out and those should be measurable through key performance indicators the metrics which can convey progress toward those goals since there are as many visions and missions as there are strategies conversely there are infinite possibilities of brand objectives nevertheless we can identify some common objectives for brand marketers establish an identity for the brand especially for small businesses and startups measured with surveys to understand if the brand is viewed by your target audience increased brand recognition of its unique attributes such as visual symbols logo packaging colors or even a unique audio signature like the tata of dolby for example again this can be measured through brand recognition surveys we often joke that a campaign without a goal is merely an awareness campaign by default but seriously speaking increasing brand awareness is a legitimate objective it represents the percentage of customers who can recall your brand and being top of mind being the first brand that comes to mind for your target audience as its value engagement is also an important objective and just like engagement in a real relationship can mean very different things what constitutes engagement is your prerogative so don't forget to clearly define it oftentimes engagement on a website is defined in terms of number of page views or time spent on the website while on social media engagement might be the number of comments likes and shares increasing the number of customers who regularly purchase your brand means increasing loyalty and when you know that acquiring new customers is a factor more expensive than keeping existing ones this counts for a lot in your profitability in this age of social media and influencers increasing advocacy can ultimately lower your marketing costs brand equity the value of your brand is another way to measure how successful your brand is your objective as a brand marketer might be to increase brand equity over time what's unique about brand equity is the commercial value that derives from consumer perception of the brand rather than the revenue derived from the product or service itself that is the brand equity is from the customer perspective speaking of financial value we can avoid market share the percentage of your target market that are customers and ultimately all of the above will impact your revenue margins brand promise your brand promise is a distilled version of your company vision and mission statement meant to inspire your current and potential customers instead of describing how you do what you do your brand promise describes the experience you deliver to your customers it's what sets you apart and is a way your customers can hold you accountable for if your brand doesn't deliver what you promised in time customers will hold you accountable and eventually they will make you pay the price in today's social media world vetting out broken brand promises immediately impacts credibility and your brand's perceived value and this is true regardless of the type of industry brand promises are constantly being demonstrated through your actions and tactics great brands also convey great promises and expectations there are a couple of key attributes of good brand promises they are indicate specific experience you can expect for example revlon says feel like a woman make it obvious why you are different m m's melt in your mouth not in your hands is a great example make your brand promise quantifiable the entrance company geiko says 15 minutes or less can save you 15 percent or more on car entrance use actionable language be more than descriptives or aspirational what's the end game for example disney says creating happiness through magical experiences keep it short and easy to understand save money live better is walmart be bold be honest don't over promise something you can't live for which brings the next one speak to what matters most to your core customers and most loyal advocates the brand experience needs to closely match the brand promise you certainly don't have to encompass every single element of your brand experience in everything you do but you want to be consistently promoting what makes you stand out nike does an excellent job at conveying its brand promise consistently be it a full page advertisement in a magazine or a banner ad on a website with such a strong brand they can simply use their iconic black and white logo to state a simple but powerful message nike's brand promise is so strong that people don't wear shoes they wear nike brand as a product or an asset the perception of a brand is defined by what consumers see when they think about your company and its products this perception is influenced in two ways by what you show people and by what they experience if we contrast and compare products and brands we can uncover some universal truth companies make products consumers build brands products can be copied and replaced by competitors but brands are unique and cannot be duplicated products will eventually become obsolete but brands can renew themselves innovate and be timeless products are useful but brands are significant how digital is revolutionizing branding consumer customers and employee behavior continues to evolve along with technology while marketing remains in a crosshairs of disruption the revolution started with the internet but quickly accelerated due to social mobile internet of things and the promise of automation and artificial intelligence take those three areas of transformation as the internet and the web evolved organizations migrated their service and product online while updating their technical infrastructure what we call the martech stack those technologies and services used by digital marketers followed suit frictions were removed and organizations had to stick their claim on the web and social media marketers were used to push their message on tv radio newspapers and magazines but consumers had a new voice and they share their likes and dislike about brands sometimes harshly brands couldn't ignore the true voice of their customers anymore one of the most powerful shift in our time is the mainstreaming of mobile technologies and how it transformed our behavior it's anytime anywhere nature broke down the classic linear sales funnel into a consumer journey influenced by micro moments brand experiences transformation and primitives consumers now expect image that responds to customer service requests on social media and they would rather engage digitally or as opposed to pick up the phone upspot the popular inbound marketing and sales service provider reveals that 80 of customers expect companies to respond to their social media posts within 24 hours even more 50 of customers claim they would cease doing business with a company that fails to respond to a negative social media post those negative comments are enough to influence 62 percent of customers to cease doing business with those brands another study this time from forbes reveals that 59 of customers said being treated as an individual was more important than how fast the issue was resolved that is customers expect a personalized response tailored to their needs and issues and finally in another survey of 690 people who attempted to contact a company through social media for customer support 57 percent of them expect the same response time at night and on weekends as during noble business hours digital transformation roadmap mckinsey and company puts it simply and elegantly no rule book will solve all of this a transformation is not a science the only way forward for companies to learn as it goes and figure out how to apply lessons as scale is built along the way there will be important markers for success the term digital transformation puts the emphasis on technological change but it becomes clear to anyone who understands digital technology's potential that what is afoot is less of a digital transformation and more of a fundamental rethink of the corporate model for which digital technology is a catalyst for some this transformation will be rapid for others it will be much more gradual and there will be numerous roadblocks and challenges but in every case it is inevitable it is a matter of long-term survival and sustainability contrary to other challenges the organization have faced over the years digital transformation is a never-ending journey mirroring the fast-paced digital landscape changes how to build a brand from scratch starting a brand from scratch or not much isn't easy this is commonly the case for startups small businesses or when creating a new product what should it look like how should it make people feel would it resonate with my target audience those questions inevitably come up when you start thinking

fruit customers are which competitors names come to mind when thinking about your product or service category what your customers talk about and especially how they talk about you or your competitors what is the lingua franca of your customers for example if i'm going to launch a new brand of luxury fashion apparel i might identify louis vuitton as a competitor and using social listening tool i can uncover what comes up when people talk about the brand identify your core values next define your brand's core values focus and personality which words are associated with your brand if your brain was a person a car an animal which qualities would describe him or her it sounds funny but it works is there a metaphor or a concept which can describe your brand easily what's your positioning statement can you fill out the proposed statement something like we offer water bottles for hikers to stay hydrated while reducing their carbon footprint unlike other water bottles brands we plant a tree for every bottle you buy this is pretty much what the canadian company 103.ca sells choose your business name choosing a business name is difficult and there are many ways to do it you can make up a completely new word like kodak you can reframe a totally unrelated word into something else like apple for computers use a metaphor or a suggestive word in line with your business like buffer you can literally describe what you do like the shoe company i thought they can be easily imitated add or remove letters like tumblr or use latin root to alter a word like activia you could use an abbreviation like hbo for own box office combine two words pinterest or facebook or turn several words into an acronym like bmw define your branding attributes once you've got a name you'll need to think about how you will visually represent your brand its colors typography and imagery color psychology isn't an exact science but we know colors are more than the simple look of your brand they also convey the feeling you want to communicate this infographic from the logo company offer a nice overview of the emotions and association that different colors generally evoke write a slogan that aligns with your mission a catchy slogan isn't necessary but if you can think of something brief and descriptive that you can put in your twitter bio website headlines business cards and anywhere else where you've got a few words to make a big impact it definitely helps your branding efforts a good slogan is short catchy and makes a strong impression here are some ways to approach writing a slogan of your own you could stake your claim death wish coffee use the world's strongest coffee make a metaphor like red bull gives your wing embrace your customers feeling loyal because you're worth it leverage labels cards against humanity a party game for horrible people write a rhyme folger's coffee the best part of waking up is folgers in your cup or describe it literally ariza use women's fashion boutique design your logo a logo is probably one of the first thing that comes to mind when people think about branding of course it's the face of your company after all and could potentially be everywhere you'll want a logo that's unique identifiable and that's scalable to work on all size and across all mediums consider all the places where your brand logo could be shown from your website to your facebook page profile picture to even the little five icons you see in your browser tab there are various ways to think about a logo is it going to be abstract a mascot or emblem maybe it will simply use letters or words or a combination of an icon and a few words apply and evolve your branding your role as a brand marketer will be to consistently use it across every possible scenario your role is to nudge customers in the right direction make a great first impression and manage your reputation but remember you will never have 100 control over how people perceive your brand initially you should focus on three points build customer trust and develop good audiences rather than trying to beat competitors at all costs welcome ideas in foster a culture where changes are welcome brands remain relevant when they adapt to their changing environment the classic build and they will come rarely works watch listen and learn before you move branding kpis once you have done all of this there are three key performance indicator that you want to track brand awareness the percentage of customers who can recall your brand loyalty or retention rate the percentage of customers the company has retained over a given time period and its opposite metric churn rate or attrition advocacy can be measured in different ways net promoter score is one method measuring the frequency and quality of brand mentions could be another brands within a brand building and nurturing brands within a multi-brand organization is somewhat similar to what we've just seen for startups and small businesses but it poses its own set of challenges a multi-brand strategy does exactly what it says it approaches multiple similar and competitive brands of the same company under the disguise of different brand names the idea behind a multi-brand strategy is often to restrict and interfere with the competition and in doing so capture a larger share of the overall market types of multi-brand strategies we can distinguish three broad scenarios of multi-brand companies first case is when the only thing that differentiates products from competitors is the brand image or identity for example fedex has various services like fedex premium fedex cargo fedex light fedex office etc here the differentiation is with respect to the function of the brand identity and the brand name is kept the same if the main idea of the corporation is shared among every product the organizations offer then having multiple products under a single brand is a wise approach and an efficient decision the second scenario is when the distinction is made through different brand names but under a strong parent company name products and services offered by numerous virgin group limited distinct brands are always proud that they were bred from a worldwide brand but this strategy carries certain risks for example if any of the underlying products fail it might reflect on the whole organization of course proper management and supervision can significantly minimize this risk and our last example is where brand names are kept distinct and the audience has no clue as to which brand belongs to the parent company larger corporations run multi-brand strategy as a way to differentiate individual brands running in the same market at the same time sometimes there is even internal competition amongst different products sharing the same parent company or in some cases the same product might be branded differently in different cultures and geographies for example soccer produced by marc is a drug used along with exercise diet and weight loss to decrease elevated lipid levels the exact same drug is known as lipex in australia new zealand croatia and a few other countries geographies you might have noticed some products brands or stores have different names in different countries there are several possibilities some global companies come up with new brand name in different countries because theirs is already taken while expanding in australia burger king had to come up with another name as burger king was already trademarked by a takeaway restaurant so they called it hungry jax in other cases the brand needs to adapt to the local language mr clean is known as don limpio in spain mastro lindo in italy mr proper in germany pan proper in poland or mr prop in belgium and france and yet they all share the same bald-headed swan guy who will help you clean sometimes it's preferable to keep a well-established local brand even after an acquisition potato shapes brand lays is called smiths in australia and lastly companies have to be careful about their brand names because the meaning can be different in foreign languages initially mercedes benz entered the chinese market under the brand name benzie which means rush to die or this other time when pepsi slogan pepsi brings you back to life debuted in china as pepsi brings you back from the grave okay we have covered a lot of ground in thinking about your brand strategy here's a summary of what you should take away from this lesson thinking of your brand values vision mission objectives and action as a pyramid will help you go from your aspirations to specific and tangible outcomes over time the value of a brand can surpass the value of the individual products it represents a brand is an important asset digital already transformed the brand customer relationship and it's not over so the term transformation should become a way of life for your organization revisiting your brand as if it were a startup can shed a new light and help drive changes while other factors like geographies and culture can significantly alter its perception hi there if you like this video subscribe to the simply learn youtube

vGPTlklcdUM,3 Social Media Marketing Strategies GUARANTEED To Grow Your Business,Unknown,231585,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGPTlklcdUM/hq720.jpg,2023-11-30 00:00:00,515,Adam Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPTlklcdUM,in this video I'm going to give you some of my best social media marketing tips to help you get more reach more engagement and more sales from your social media and I'll walk you through step by step a social media marketing strategy that's working better than anything else right now and it all starts by first understanding that things have changed and they're never going back so if you've been trying to use social media to grow your business get more customers or build up an audience and you're not getting the results you were hoping for I've got good news it's not your fault it's just that there have been a lot of very big changes to the different social media algorithms and how the platforms decide and prioritize what content gets promoted and shown and most importantly of all how all of this is impacting your current and potential social media audience so the secret then to solving this once and for all first starts with understanding the importance of marketing strategy number one Niche marketing of all of the marketing strategies that I'm going to share with you here today there is perhaps none more powerful than that of Niche marketing but before I show you how it's done we first need to cover two very important things the first is what exactly is Niche marketing anyway well my friend I'm glad you asked because when it comes to marketing there are two very different strategies the first is mass marketing which is where you try to go after anyone and everyone this is what the big billion dooll Brands often do and this is what most people think of when they think of marketing or advertising the problem though is that when smaller or medium or even large businesses try to copy this Mass Market approach they quickly realize that it's just not a very effective strategy for them this is because it's nearly impossible to try to reach everyone not to mention the fact that most people out there simply aren't a good fit for you or your business so you're wasting your precious time and money and marketing dollars on people who are never going to buy anyway so this is where Niche marketing comes in a significantly better approach for pretty much every single business out there what Niche marketing does is identify a smaller segment within the much larger Mass Market a segment or Niche that has its own specific set of needs or wants or desires or whatever and by going after a small segment of the market you can get a lot more bang for your marketing Buck because now you can tailor your message to the exact people that you're trying to reach for example if you're selling toothpaste well the mass Market approach would be to go after everyone in the world that has teeth for easy math here let's say we have 8 billion people in the world and we'll just say that they all have teeth well that's a lot of people so this is where you would start to Niche down to find segments of the market that would be most interested in the kind of toothpaste that you want to make like toothpaste for sensitive teeth or whitening toothpaste or pickle flavored toothpaste which yes is very much a thing and is proof that you absolutely can Niche down and probably a whole lot more than you thought all right so now that we've got that covered the next thing then is how do you properly pronounce Niche anyway after all you may have heard it called Niche like I've said throughout this video but maybe also Niche or nich so to help you remember I wrote a little song now when you think of a n just think of baking ay or like a dog on a leash or maybe saying cuz when you do it this way you'll never make a mistake you won't have egg on your face I'm always saying it wrong okay next up we have one of the most controversial marketing statements of all time but the facts don't lie even though this next one may be a tough pill to swallow if you really want to grow your business then you're going to need to put down the perfectionist hat and put on the publisher hat have you guys seen my publisher hat and this is because it's time to make stuff a lot of stuff and that means prioritizing quantity over quality if you've ever read a blog post or listened to a podcast or seen a video on content marketing that I know you've come across the age-old advice to publish high quality content on a consistent basis everyone says this and they're not wrong quality content on a consistent basis is one of the biggest keys to success in marketing but it's the end point not the start quality content isn't something that just happens right out of the gate takes practice and engaging with your audience and slowly building up your content creation skills and so the advice to focus on creat the highest quality content you possibly can often causes people to give up before they even get going to agonize over their content and to too harshly judge their own creations and in the end well this basically leads to them never doing anything for fear how they or how their content might be perceived but the reality is that in this hyper competitive market more really is better different is better and better may not actually be better because quality is subjective so what looks terrible to you might look amazing to someone else and probably does so if you're currently putting out one video a month try to make it weekly if you're sending out a weekly marketing email try three times a week or maybe even daily and if you're putting out daily Instagram content well you could try twice a day dare I say three times a day anyway here are four things that'll help you do that first just use your phone camera you probably have it with you all day every day so you might as well get creating next you could invest in a marketing specific video camera something that you carry with you and you know it's time to record content when that bad boy comes out plus there's always good oldfashioned pen and paper I talked about this being one of the most important things that Richard Branson who now owns more than 400 different companies carries with them all the time you see it's

81bLdOJwteA,The Secret to Building a Personal Brandâ€”Reduce Your Market Size & Create Clear Messaging,Unknown,231217,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/81bLdOJwteA/hq720.jpg,2023-03-10 00:00:00,354,The Futur,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bLdOJwteA,you golf with someone who's terrible your golf game will go down you golf with Tiger Woods your golf game will go up you just rise or sink to whoever you spend the most time with spend a lot of time teaching study pedagogical models I've been trained by people who train teachers and I like geek out with teachers and coaches and facilitators so if you all want to learn how to teach better I will work on that with you one of the things I always do whenever I'm coaching someone whatever they say I automatically assume they don't know what they're talking about they haven't spent enough time thinking about it and those are probably not the words they would choose to say it and if you operate like that with your clients but without the attitude that I bring you'll do really well so John's like blah blah blah the first thing you should ask yourself is how do you know this is true and if you ask anybody this most of the times because you have no proof whatsoever they'll start to unravel their own thinking so this is a sales negotiation thing too like this should be cheaper well what evidence do you have that that's true they got nothing because they just just pulled it out that's what people do all the time and I think we're all like raised in a certain way in our culture to like to blend in we talked about that so the the Instinct that you have inside is just to blend in all the time to be like everyone to say things that will not offend anybody because you're afraid to think critically I don't try to be offensive but I want to think critically and sometimes that is offensive and it's okay because I'm not trying to be here for everybody the number one theme I heard from yesterday and the little conversations that I've had people are afraid to make a decision to reduce the market size and they resist and they resist and they resist I would ask somebody I think it was Ernesto or somebody I'm forgetting the name sorry I'm like do you want to serve men or women he's like both that wasn't one of the two options I gave you want to serve men or women right and then eventually someone would say women uh you want to serve older women or younger older you want to serve married single mom what do you and when you start to get to that all of a sudden the messaging becomes so clear it becomes really clear so one of the things that you're all going to have to do and you'll fight me and you'll fight me for a really long time until you start to figure out who you're speaking to none of your messaging will work it'll be super generic so what do you do instead you get templates and you get scripts and then everybody in this room follows the exact same template in scripts and you're like how do we be different well you're not templates are helpful but you gotta do it your way so usually in the process of learning what we want to do is follow the template exactly as it was given to us don't deviate don't change don't modify learn the martial art first and then as soon as you feel like you put in enough reps start to improvise start to add your formula now most of the things that I do today are a product of accident and just being willing enough to try it just to try stuff like to wear the hat it was to solve a shiny head problem picking certain colors because I just I need to stand out and eventually I was at the Grove with video conference and Neil was there and somebody cornered me I wasn't even speaking like Chris love your style I could see you from like 20 feet away I know it's you I just know I'm like how do you know he goes and he was super aggressive he's like you you will teach me how to be more stylish I'm like I don't even do that I don't even do client work I promise you you will teach me I will pay you we'll figure it out and so I think it was was it Jeff we talked about like vertical integration like different businesses come out I'm like okay well teach you personal style don't be your stylist I guess with enough money I will I can help you right so it's just about leaning into the stuff that you feel and this is going to be weird maybe shameful of that you feel guilty for that you're afraid to show with the world and as soon as you do that you start to stand out right away I had this conversation with someone that's like there isn't original content I know you want to be original the pursuit of originality is just a Fool's errand the only things that are original usually happen through technology and like if you're writing a technological wave you're you can do something that might feel original like for example I saw somebody it was an exhibition I think it was for like Magritte or somebody like that I think it was Magritte they took the painting and made a real life three-dimensional sculpture out of it so they use technology to transform an old idea it's not even a new idea it's just a new application of an old idea right so here it is Jim Rohn says what you're the average of The Five People You spend the most time with right The Godfather the philosopher the business Guru Gary vaynerchuk says get rid of one loser friend same idea different voice because Gary knows who he is and Gary's the master at doing sound bites that are going to drive people insane right are you saying my friends are losers and you're not about people no he's just saying you spend enough time with people you become like this it's a law of averages it's going to be that way right you golf with someone who's terrible your golf game will go down you go off with Tiger Woods your golf game will go up you just rise or sink to whoever you spend the most time with so these are not new ideas so what you want to do is you want to read you want to take courses you want to do group coaching you want to filter it through your voice and who you are the weird thing is it's the most natural thing to do it's just you resist it because you know why like when you were like four and somebody walked by and you're like Mom that person's weird like don't say that don't Point don't say those things we don't do that in polite company enough of that would then change who you are so that you're suppressed that there's like if you do like inner work like Psychotherapy you'll know that there's this inner voice inside your head that sounds a lot like you that you think is you it is not you it's the voice of one or both of your most dominant parent whoever uh parented you you know so that's kind of what the stuff that we have to work through I'm sorry we got a little deep

WWvXEI3aC_A,WHAT CONTENT TO POST BEFORE LAUNCH DAY | PRE-LAUNCH CONTENT | LAUNCH MARKETING STRATEGY,Unknown,54660,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WWvXEI3aC_A/hq720.jpg,2023-02-04 00:00:00,873,The Brand Hustler,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWvXEI3aC_A,yes you should be posting content before you launch and no you shouldn't just be posting any and everything there are actually three main types of content that you want to make sure that you post during your pre-launch and in this video you are going to learn all about them stay tuned [Music] hey I'm Chanel the brand Hustler and this is a channel for all of my hustle babes who are interested in getting Insight on the entrepreneurial Journey while learning essential marketing and business tips for their brand and throughout this entire week I have been dropping back-to-back videos to get you geared up for your launch we've been talking about building a brand target audience creating a launch strategy promoting and launch we've been talking all the things and in this video we are talking all about content because there are levels to this content game especially when it comes to your pre-launch so if you haven't checked out any of the other videos that drop during launch-a-thon make sure that you check them out after this video the linked playlist will be on the screen and it'll also be on the end screen and in the description box you cannot miss it also make sure that you give this video a thumbs up if this video and any other video that I have posted has been super helpful to you show me love so that I can know that y'all like what I'm putting out okay now like I said this video is going to be all about content that you should be posting during your pre-launch specifically I am going to be sharing the goal of your pre-launch content I am also going to be sharing the three types of content that you should be posting during your pre-launch stage and I'm also going to share some ways so that you can know how to organize your content okay so if you are super excited for that let me know in the comment section and comment down below just expressing your excitement and then also share what business it is that you are launching or relaunching and when you intend on launching so that we can support your launch now let's get into this video diving right in let's talk about the goal of your pre-launch content pre-launch content is content nonetheless but pre-launch content it's your foot in the game okay it is your chance to make your first impression pretty much think about your pre-launch content as if this was your debut album because this is the first piece of anything that you are putting out that people are going to Know You by and know your brand by okay still to this day I will scroll down a Brand's Instagram to kind of see what they posted when they first started obviously there's room for growth and all the things but when you first start there's a level of connection that's expected from your content and also there's a level of oh your brand is the ish when you first launch okay and so the goal of your pre-launch content is to get your audience members to feel like that to get them to feel like your brand is the sugar honey iced tea baby okay you want them to be excited for your launch you want them to talk about it as if this is the hottest High School dance around get their outfits ready you know how in high school when you had a dance coming up up and people kept talking about it or they kept saying like announcements about it you saw posters around the school people were talking about who they was going to bring as a date what outfit they was wearing got you excited you started going like shopping or begging your mama and your daddy to take you shopping you started you know planning your hairstyles and doing all the things to get prepped for this High School dance your launch is the high school dance that you want your audience to get prepped for so you want to be able to give them content that is exciting but give them content that gives them enough context to know exactly what is coming up so that they could prep their wallets for when you open up shops another reason that pre-launch content is so important and another goal of pre-launch content is honestly to attract your target audience like I said this is your first kind of album this is your debut album this is your first foot in the door okay you want to be able to create content so that your audience out there they know that this brand is for them they know that you solve their problem in a unique way that resonates with them their personalities and their lifestyle and if you need to learn more about target audience I did share a video earlier this week about target audience I will put it on the screen however I do have a live training all about creating a launch marketing strategy where we are going to dive deeper into building a brand creating brand awareness hashing up your target audience and we're going to really break down the stages of a launch marketing strategy and what you should be doing in each stage so that way you can use it to your advantage and launch your product based business the right way or relaunch it um the right way as well now for the next part of the video I am going to be sharing the three main types of content that you want to make sure that your brand is sharing during your pre-launch stage so to clarify your pre-launch stage is the stage before are you even launch okay it is the stage before you open up shop so keep that in mind now the three types of content that you should be sharing are hype solution and connection content and let's break it down a little bit so you have your hype content your hype content is the content that paints your brand as the it Factor those are the videos that are cinematic these are the pictures that tell a story and are shareable and heavy hitting these are the teasers of your products these are all the things that get people hyped to want to learn more get people hyped to want to shop with you once you open your doors that is what hype content is okay and you want to make sure that you're creating hype content because of what we just talked about so make sure that hype content is one of the contents that you create and then the second type which is your solution type content this is where you really drive home the solution that you provide and what problem you're addressing so solution content is like your content that provides quick wins or hacks and things like that that are related to your products and related to your industry and the world that your brand actually lives in and so when you post solution content pre-launch it does a great job of speaking to your audience's pain points it gets inside of their brains of what they're experiencing maybe it's dry skin and you you know you call out that pain point and you give them a quick win for it then they know that you are a brand for them and that you have what they need the third type of content is connection content this is probably like my favorite now um before I really love solution content but as the world continues to evolve connection content is more important now than ever and so connection content is pretty much what it sounds like it is where you are connecting with your audience in relatable ways okay so you are sharing like the emotional side um to you and emotions doesn't have to be sappy all the time but you're sharing your emotions with them you're sharing your Brand Story You're sharing elements of yourself as the CEO and elements of your brand and your products that can connect to your audience so for example if I had a candle company and my scents were flavored tropical scents that I you know took from growing up on a Caribbean Island I would want to share the story of how when I was younger um I saw my grandma like you know grow these beautiful and exotic fruits in her garden and all the things and I was obsessed with the smell and the taste of them and so I wanted to replicate that smell so that my home always reminds me of my grandmother and that's why I created these these candles someone else who has a strong connection with their grandmother um can relate to that or someone else who grew up in the in the islands in the Caribbean can relate to that or someone who loves the smell and taste of exotic fruits can relate to that and that right there builds that connection link between me and the end consumer on the other end of the screen now now that we've talked about the three types of content and I've also shared the goal of your pre-launch content let's talk about how we can actually organize this right because content is not just social media content content is everywhere you have email content text messages that you send out our content and of course you got social media content but even like the captions on social media are content content it's everywhere content is something that tells a story in every aspect your pictures to tell a story your videos should tell a story your caption should tell a story now obviously you don't want to OD it there's a method behind it which if you come to the training we'll talk about so make sure that you open up the description box and check that out but because they're all of these different types of content and pieces of content you want to make sure that you organize them in one central location so that way you relieve stress and you make it easier for you to actually post a darn thing so one of the things that I highly suggest you create is some form of a Content calendar you want to create this content calendar and map out the specific dates and what content is dropping and on what channel is it an email is it a social media blast on Instagram what exactly is it are you going live you want to be very detailed with that another thing that you want to do as well is you want to make sure that you have your content system mapped out and written out to a T So how do you collect these content ideas when do you shoot the photos and videos when do you create the captions how do you do that do you have a graphic designer that you're working with do you have an assistant maybe you're is it your sister your mom whatever that's helping you that they can tackle some of these and schedule them in whatever the case may be map out what that step-to-step process is like and use it to create your content creation system I usually do this on a coda which is coda.io I create my own document from scratch I also use like Excel not Excel but Google Sheets and Google documents to create this so if uh you are in the ultimate launch course which is of course all about launching and you'll learn about that later but if you're in the ultimate launch course I actually have a pre-filled Content calendar on a Google Drive that I share with all of the students within the ultimate launch course but more recently I actually shared my kind of content toolkit which includes the system in which I land content and includes an area for you to map out your content on a calendar to analyze your content and all of that and so if you're interested in that it is a 49 and I'll leave that in the description box as well so that way you can grab that and sign up for the training and we could get you ready to launch this bad boy okay so make sure that you check those out um I really hope that this video was helpful to you I just wanted to come on here really quick and just share the types of content that you should be creating and also just share ways that you can organize and the goal of your content I didn't want this video to be too too long because I don't want you to get stuck in your head okay just create the content take what I am telling you and obviously pair it with the strategy that you are using for your launch or your relaunch um whether it's a new business an old business a new collection and just really like get out there and do the darn thing learn but then apply a lot of times we find ourselves just learning learning learn learning learning learning and we don't actually apply anything you never know what works for you and you can't actually tweak to elevate unless you actually apply so apply what I just said in this video apply what I said in all my other videos that I shared and also when you come to the training apply what I say in that training and if I do decide to share ways that you can work with me and you join those ways to work with me please apply what it is that you learn within that program okay I have seen clients blow their goals out of the water okay I had a client who sold out within 48 hours I had a client who sold 50 orders within like her first I think week or two I had clients that have made over a thousand dollars in a week of their launch I had clients make you know consistent 330 Dollar Days which if you add that up it equates to over a hundred thousand and so these are the results of when you actually apply what it is that you are learning so apply it okay I really hope that this video was helpful to you and if it was make sure that you give this video a thumbs up and share it with someone that you know that it can help if you're not subscribed to this channel already hit the subscription button hit the notification Bell so that way you know when I upload y'all all of this information that I said works and all of the information that I shared earlier in the launch-a-thon works as well because I am going to be using this for my new product business as well so that's a little T right there okay your girl is launching a product based business this year and I'm gonna be sharing my journey and taking you guys along with me so if you want to see that make sure that you definitely hit the notification Bell definitely subscribe and be ready for these gems if you are not following me on Instagram or Tick Tock head over there and follow me at the brand Hustler I drop gems over there as well and we get lit over there okay now y'all make me proud okay make me proud with your launches and if you are coming to the training I'll see you there and if not I'ma see you in the next video alright hustle babes bye
PKUn7wU5sIc,How to Develop a Social Media Strategy Step by Step,Unknown,903048,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PKUn7wU5sIc/hq720.jpg,2020-09-11 00:00:00,1497,THE FREELANCE FRIDAY PODCAST,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKUn7wU5sIc,if it's just a vanity metric if they just want more likes or just want more followers you all know as well as i do that those things mean nothing without action hey everyone what's up welcome back to the freelance friday podcast so welcome back to the podcast you guys i want to read a quick apple podcast review for you all this one comes from ceramics business ceramics business says that this podcast is so relatable even outside your field i really appreciate latasha's friendly professional and authentic thoughts as a listener you feel like you're talking to someone who knows their stuff but also like you are having a professional coffee date with a close friend honest open and gets into the grit we are having a coffee day thank you so much i love that review that was so nice so today i'm talking about social media strategy this is a really big question a really big important thing for anyone out there who is a social media manager i know a lot of you all are and even if you're not i think this is going to be helpful for you because you probably need to use social media for your business or you know your brand or whatever it is that you are doing so here's how to create a social media strategy this is the blueprint so the first thing that you need to do is set goals and i'm going to be speaking from a client service provider relationship so i'm going to be sharing with you guys how i uh you know start these conversations with my clients and get them all set up and all that but again you can apply this to your own business or whatever you want to do with it so set goals is the first thing that you're going to need to do when somebody reaches out to me and they say hey latasha can you help us develop a social media strategy i say absolutely what are your business goals that's literally like the next question that comes out of my mouth when i have those conversations and i need to know what their their regular business goals are so that way i can take those business goals and i can create my own social media specific goals and from there what's going to be the output from that is metrics that we can measure you know as tangible as you can get in a digital medium so let me give you an example e-commerce is probably always the easiest one to share because it's the easiest to measure so an e-commerce company let's say that they are a footwear brand they want to sell more shoes and in particular they want to sell more of a specific type of shoe maybe they're an athletic shoe company but they want people to know that they have casual sandals too and so they're really looking to boost sales in that specific category so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay great so we are going to have a goal of getting more conversion goals completed so that means sales you know clicks over to our website things like that and then those metrics that can actually measure especially if they have tracking set up properly which they should have like google analytics facebook pixel all that i can actually track through okay here's how many sales came from social media or if you know maybe they're like a very new brand they don't have that sophisticated of tracking on their website i can at least say hey i sent 500 people over to your website from social media last month and that is going to be the closest that you can get because obviously you know if somebody's clicking over to the website on a sales type post likely they're going to buy or at least they're interested in purchasing so that is kind of the full path and you have to have you have to have a goal right you have to because i could take that same shoe company and i could say awesome you you want me to do your social media we don't talk about goals and i say awesome i'm going to grow their social media following so much and i'm going to do nothing but influence or collaborations i might buy some you know followers which you guys know i don't recommend but i could a lot of social media strategists do that and they're going to be really impressed because i'm going to get them a million followers by the end of the year but if they didn't get any sales from those million followers it literally means nothing obviously they would probably get something i would hope from a million followers but you know that might not be their main goal their main goal might not be followers on the contrary sometimes the client will come to me and say we want a bunch of followers and i'm like okay cool why like tell me tell me what the thought process is on why you want to grow your following they'll be like oh yeah we want more sales and i'm like well maybe what you need to do is just reach your existing following a little better obviously i'm never going to say you don't want to grow your following but focusing on those metrics can sometimes be a little bit of recipe for disaster if it's you know if it's just a vanity metric if they just want more likes or just want more followers you all know as well as i do that those things mean nothing without action so it might really be that we need to actually boost our engagement so that our posts start showing up in our followers feeds more and you know our existing followership actually buys from us and sees what we have going on and what we have to sell to them so uh yeah goals super important and it's important to be aligned with this too with your with your client to like be on the same page about it from day one let them know okay we have this conversation so these are my social goals these are the metrics i can provide you at the end of every month the you know and be in communication about it so that there's no surprise that they're not they're not surprised for better for worse i mean i guess for better is good under promise over deliver is never a bad thing but you definitely want to be on the same page about goals i personally always use the smart acronym specific measurable attainable relevant and timely and that's how i formulate my goals because even even the example that i shared with the shoe company they want to sell more uh slides or sandals or whatever what is more like one more 20 more a thousand more 10 000 more units like you do have to know that as well especially when you're doing like paid advertising because i'm gonna need a way different paid budget for 10 000 more units versus like 20 more units timelines when do they want to sell those buy do they want to increase those sales over a three year period or do they want to increase those sales over like the next week that's also very important and it's going to affect your strategy your budget the price that you're taking because you're going to be working overtime if they want to sell 10 000 units in a week you know all that stuff is super important to get on the same page about so specific measurable attainable relevant timely those are your goals next thing you're going to want to do is do some persona research you're going to want to understand who the heck you're selling to or talking to on social media so hopefully your client is going to know this and this is like question two that i asked them i said great i know your goals so who are we talking to here who is your audience who are your customers what types of people tend to you know buy from you who are you trying to reach because that might be two different things their typical customers might be one thing their goal customers or clients might be somebody else so important to have those conversations there and hopefully they will know and these are also really good um conversations to have to kind of gauge your customer engage your clients and maybe get an understanding of what type of client they're going to be because when i have a client who doesn't know any of these answers it scares me a little bit i'm gonna be honest i mean it's my job to help them through a lot of this stuff and make those recommendations of you know doing as much research as i can but maybe they need to pull in like a you know a research tool or something as well it's my job to make those recommendations but at the same time i mean i'm a business owner i can tell you five things about my following or my ideal client just off the top of my head and you should be able to i think as a business owner i think it's important to be able to speak to those things you might not know the social specific versions of those things you know i don't i don't personally know how to do google ads very well so if i were to say hey i want to run some google ads and go to an agency or a freelancer i could tell them a few things about my search traffic or my ideal client who i'm trying to reach i might not know how to put those into google terms like i might not know the targeting layers available for google but i can tell them in plain speech i want to reach startup people in these specific geographic locations and blah blah blah blah so i'm not saying it's a full-on red flag but they should be able to work with you and i think if they're not willing to like work with you and do a little research do a little digging themselves do some exercises maybe that you provide them that's not really a good sign you know you're you're not like a footwear expert right like you're a social media manager so you do need them to work with you i think this is super important anyway tangent there but persona research who are they trying to reach um anything is helpful here age gender geographic location any types of like um cultural references that they like like maybe they like shit's creek is that what it's called i don't know why that's like the first tv show that came to mind for me but maybe they like that show maybe they like game of thrones maybe they like video games maybe they like sports like all of those things are gonna help influence the tone and voice that you're gonna use in your social media messaging so like game of thrones was huge that was like a cultural phenomenon right and i know i mean tons of brands you know tweeted along with the show and like injected their brand in it somehow starbucks for example remember when the starbucks cup was left on the production room um you know in the shot i mean just knowing things like that so you can make jokes and be culturally relevant and use the right tone and voice is super important so get as much of that as you can if they really don't know that stuff again hopefully they're going to be willing to work with you and they should be able to at least help pull their analytics for you slash you can do this yourself if you have access to their accounts look at who is currently following them go into your facebook page insights go into instagram insights twitter doesn't really have analytics anymore unfortunately uh linkedin is pretty kind of limited i need to do an update on my analytics series actually maybe i'll do that soon but look at who's currently following them if they do have anything of a following if they have nothing of a following then that's a little bit challenging as well but you can still do some research look at their website information so if they have google analytics or even just like squarespace's native analytics and wordpress like their native analytics i'm pretty sure it gives you a little bit of information about at least geographic location of where people are coming from so you can gather little tidbits here and there you can also do some of your own kind of diy market market research so you can post into facebook groups forums you know look on reddit look on i can never say this word properly i think it's kia ora quora i don't know how to say it but that website just like start searching around and see handbags you know okay your client is a handbag company start typing handbag into kiara luxury bag like whatever it is and see what questions people are asking see what types of people are asking those questions and so on and so forth and just take note of those things because you do you really have to understand who you're talking to if you want your message to get across properly next thing that i recommend doing is competitor research so very similar to market research you're just gonna take a look at what their competitors are doing if my client is louis vuitton i'm going to take a look at you know i don't know chloe and dior um and take a look at their you know what they're doing to promote their handbags or their their design house or whatever so real simple stuff here just take a look at like how often they're posting on their social channels which social channels they're leveraging i think this is really important because you don't have to be on every social platform i mean i think that's like one of the biggest myths in social media strategy today is that you need to be doing everything and you don't especially if you are a freelancer watching this a one one person show you realistically unless they're paying you a lot of money and you have a lot of time you probably are not going to be doing like 10 social media platforms for them you're probably going to be focusing on like a handful and doing a really good job and maybe repurposing content for the other ones but you're probably not going to be like creating original content for like linkedin instagram twitter youtube facebook podcast i mean that's not really social media but whatever you're probably not going to be doing that right so take a look at what the competitors are on so that way you know either to one of two things one where there's a gap in the market because sometimes that can be fun if there's no podcast about handbags maybe that's a good area of opportunity if the demographics line up you know your ideal client demographics line up with podcast listenership maybe that's a gap in the market that you can kind of um take you know you can you can take that over or you can follow their lead so if you're seeing oh my gosh this company is getting such good traffic engagement all that stuff from instagram we need to be on instagram they're selling so much on instagram then be on instagram but it you know it can do a couple of different things it can teach you what to do or what not to do really let's take a look at platforms posting frequency just the types of content that they're posting again you can take a look at who's following them any public data that you can see like see what types of people are following them maybe some other brands that their followers tend to follow so you can kind of paint a picture of that persona so do a little bit of competitor research and this is really helpful too to get buy-in from the client so especially when i work with more corporate companies or even startups who have like investors and stuff that they need to kind of get approval on for everything if i can say okay well you know i'm making this completely up these are none of my clients but like my client is honda well let's look at what chevrolet is doing and typically the investor or the manager or the owner is going to be like oh okay cool with the competitors doing that we need to do that like if they're running facebook ads we uh here's some budget for facebook ads so it can help with getting that buy-in if you kind of give that like well everybody else is doing it it's kind of like when i don't have kids but like i just feel like all of my parent friends are like yeah like my kid is like well so-and-so has a phone already so i bought him a phone or like he has an ipad so i bought him an ipad you know it's the same kind of thing except with it's data driven you know it's done for a good reason it's not done for selfish causes okay so competitor analysis and these are all things too by the way really you know i guess goal setting not so much but persona research competitor analysis this next thing that i'm going to mention social audit these are all things that you can price out individually as well so if you are going to do you know monthly social media management for a client if you got to do all these steps as you can see this is like a lot of work i mean this is like weeks of work on its own you can charge that you can price that into your startup fee so the first month you're going to be doing a strategy an audit a competitor analysis all this stuff tax some money on to that first month because you're going to be working a lot so that's what i do and then that way you can also price it out individually if people come to you because sometimes people do as again especially my corporate clients they'll come to me and be like hey can you do a social media strategy for us once per year so i'm not actually doing the stuff like their in-house people are implementing this stuff but they want me to come in and do their strategy work so obviously i need to have that price in my head so i can charge for that then you're going to do the social audits so this is really going to be taking a look at what they're already doing now if this is a brand new company you're launching the social channels for them you've taken that persona research that competitor research and decided all right your target audience is women ages 40 to 55. in the suburbs we're going to be on facebook number one and probably maybe instagram too you know look at like the platform stats and demographics and stuff do a little bit of research on your own to determine which platforms they need to be on okay cool you're good there but if they have an existing social presence that has already been going on before you either started out by them by a social media manager an agency whatever i want you to audit that because just because they have been doing something doesn't mean it's right necessarily it's what they should be doing so develop your own little set of criteria here take a look at uh you know just some baseline metrics and this is important for you selfishly too so that you can develop a case study and and this is something that like i've always forgotten to do and i still always forget to do is write down how many followers and you know what the average engagements were when i started working with a client because like i always forget until i've been working with them for five minutes months and it's like wait now i can't tell the whole story so that's what an audit can help you do you know get a kind of benchmark of where they're at right now how many followers they have how many engagements they're getting what content is performing really well what their uh you know analytics are showing as far as their followership data demographic data all that a preliminary report essentially and take a look at what's working and what's not and again sometimes this stuff will really surprise you i i will have in my mind like oh my gosh like these quote images do so well and then you pull the data and you're like these things are not doing anything for us or maybe they're getting like a ton of likes but nobody is clicking nobody's clicking on those links or vice versa so it's always good to do that next thing you're going to want to do from there is develop the infrastructure so this typically especially for a new company is going to be setting up a scheduling tool and a process for them so again your established companies probably already have a tool that they use and they might just onboard you onto that and show you how they use it get you a seat get you access to that but if you're doing everything yourself you're going to need to figure out do we use a scheduling tool am i going to post things natively how are we going to get the content calendars approved do i need approval you got to figure all that stuff out and then i also often especially if this is a new company go in and do sops or standard operating procedures for them if they don't have any yet and again this is another upsell and this is something that i do a lot of actually uh i think partially because i do have that like corporate background and i do a lot of training and coaching and courses so i have that um i don't know i'm kind of like a natural i naturally want to teach and document things in some way so i often will upsell that so i'll say cool like i can give you your sops meaning this is what we do and when we do it this is how the content calendars get approved uh here's an example of our escalation process so if there's a customer service issue what we do what the social media manager does with it all the numbers that they need to call if there's an emergency document that all and you can get you guys can have this you can have this whether you stay with me or not you know if you want to give this to your admin after i leave or whatever so um that's all what i kind of consider infrastructure setting up the scheduling tool doing the sops all of that good stuff and then really the last thing is just putting together a content calendar so i mean it's like the last thing but it's like the hardest thing really because it it's putting everything into motion so i personally really like the scheduling tools that i use are loomly and hootsuite but honestly lately i've been using facebook creator studio so i've been scheduling natively onto facebook and instagram and it's been doing me well but again you want to try out these different platforms scheduling tools figure out what works for you and start building your content calendar regardless of the scheduling tool that i use i typically will just build out a content calendar in like an excel spreadsheet real simple just like post image post copy link hashtags and i'll just create a you know google sheet send it over to the client get their approval get their feedback on it and that's how i'll start posting so that's really what a social media strategy is you know some or more formal than others if a client specifically is like we need a social media strategy um then i'm gonna make sure it's a really pretty nice document that has all of this information wrapped up into it whereas if it's just for me like some of my clients could care less then maybe it's just a document that i have on hand that's kind of saying okay we're going to post you know images behind the scenes images three times per week we're gonna post stories every day we're gonna post quote images twice a week like whatever that is for me so that i know when i'm creating a content calendar every week or every month however you like to do it um you know what to do so and as far as content calendars i usually usually actually do them week by week i was doing them month by month for a long time and because social and the internet moves so quickly i think it's really important to leave some room for like real time stuff and i felt like i was moving things around a lot so i do things weekly but it never hurts to have posts on hand so if you want to do a month of evergreen posts which means a post that kind of never goes old it's just kind of like standard maybe boilerplate type messaging it's never a bad idea to have a bunch of those on hand so you can just throw them in when um you need some content but i really hope this was helpful for you guys this is how you create a social media strategy these are the things that are really important to know before going in and starting to just post i mean and and just to back things up a little bit you know when is client let's say i get a client today they sign they pay and they're like yeah we want a strategy we want monthly posts you know all that stuff it doesn't mean that i'm not going to post until i have all this stuff done like in the beginning is going to be a little bit of testing and that's really a part of it too because all the data might say you should post this kind of post and sometimes things will surprise you so i'm still posting kind of testing things out but i really am developing this more formal strategy as i'm getting things going and i i will let them know typically like okay on month two like the end of month one i'm going to have a formal strategy for you and month one i'm kind of just gonna be like fixing a lot of things and testing a lot of things and all that good stuff so that's what's up hope that was helpful yeah definitely be sure to subscribe to my youtube channel if you're

that's going to make posting on social media easier and that's exactly what I'm going to be teaching you today five effective tips for building your social media strategy in 2024 don't forget to stay for the second half of this video where I will be using my own business as a case study example and revealing The Insider secrets of my own personal strategy let's dive in with step one the why your goals this might seem super simple but trust me when I say the basics work your goals are going to give you Clarity and they're going to inform the later parts of our content strategy for example someone who is focused on building their Community Connection is going to be posting different types of content than someone who is trying to get exposure or is a brand new business the next thing to consider in your social media strategy is the who this includes your competitive research and your audience analysis you need to validate your content ideas you need to understand what is trending in the industry and use the data that's already out there on Instagram what is working effectively for other industry leaders in your Niche this process can also help you find your uvp this is a very important marketing term that stands for your unique value proposition you might discover when looking at your competitors that there is a hole in the market creators who have a very strong uvp are going to grow a lot faster step number three in creating our social media strategy is the wear this is the time to choose your platform or platforms plural for myself and for my clients the strategy that's working the best at the moment is multiplatform marketing you should be choosing number one an exposure platform and number two a nurturing platform I'm going to expand on this more and what my exposure platforms are versus nurture in just a second when we dive into my own personal strategy for now jumping into step number four of five for building our strategy it's all about the how you need to decide on your posting schedule and some of the basic deliverables things like reals versus graphics carousels you want to figure out how often you're going to be making fresh new content are you scheduling in content days you need to think about Source material do you have a blog or a podcast you could repurpose from to create content for your other platforms and you need to be thinking about the technology you're going to be using are you going to be posting manually are you going to be scheduling are you using something to create a Content calendar before we dive into step five and my personal strategy I want to give a little shout out to our sponsor Riverside when it comes to TI technology that makes my social media strategy easy to implement and speed up my content creation

sponsoring the dishing up digital podcast moving on to step number five the final piece in our strategy we're rolling with this w theme we've done the who we've done the when we've done the why and now we have to finish with the what this is where your strategy should feature some content themes or content pillars now I know there are a lot of creators out there saying that content pillars are outdated and I do agree with them to a certain extent if you are using the classic copy and paste cookie cutter content pillars that people have talked about in social media marketing for the past 5 years yeah maybe a little bit outdated but I want to empower you to create your own content pillars the idea with this is it gives you some and some organization to your social media instead of just posting willy-nilly or getting to a Friday and being like Oh no I haven't posted anything what piece of content should I put out you have a structure you have a plan in place the other element here under the what category is building your social media funnel I'm going to expand on this in a second and use my business as a real example so let's recap we've got our goals is step one we've got our competitive research and our audience analysis we've got the we choosing using the right platform for us we've got the how exactly the steps of how we're going to execute this the tools and software we're going to use and then finally the what your content ideas what are you going to be sharing on social media now what I'm about to share with you is my own personal social media strategy for 2024 this is looking primarily at Instagram but all of the skills that I'm teaching you or the ideas you could definitely use on other platforms as well if you're listening on the podcast make sure you jump across on YouTube to see the screen share to see the document but for now I'm just going to read through it so I've got a couple of different categories here I've broken down my goals month by month and this is what I really wanted to illustrate in terms of different ways you can goal set because for me my social media strategy in March is going to look different from my social media strategy in April it really depends what I'm promoting what I'm offering and what my end goal is if we take this back to February 2024 which is what was the sort of entry point of my strategy cuz I drafted this up in January I had written here that my content was going to be focusing on really pushing and trying to get some viral videos content with high reach and connecting specifically with social media managers that was my goal for that month because my bigger picture business goal was to launch my program the dishing of digital school to run a really big promotion to have a discount code a 2E card open Period and to get as many signups as possible so so in February I was being very active on social media and focusing on top funnel content what I mean by this is content that is getting seen by the most amount of people possible and really driving up my exposure so that when I L into the end of February when I was ready to sell I had a larger audience or I had new people following me to sell to when I contrast that with March my March goals in my business are behind the scenes work it is building my new Instagram group coaching progr program it is warming my audience up for that phase of my business so March content really looks like nurturing growing the connection with my audience my content because my goal is to warm people up and get them to know me more my content is going to have more of an authorative tone I might post a couple of extra face to cam videos where it's me talking explaining an idea showing my opinion or my expertise because I know those are the videos that may not necessarily go viral but they do help with building the connection and getting people more down my funnel in terms of getting them ready to buy in April I go into my launch where I'm actually selling this product so my goals might be I want to sign 15 people up to my new Instagram group coaching program having those written goals help me inform what content I'm going to be creating a lot of the content in April I'm not going to care about the likes and the vanity metrics I'm going to care about sales-driven content what can I do to sell my offer how can I share more case studies more testimonials all of that good stuff do you kind of see how that contrasts with February where I was trying to get viral content and build up my exposure and I was also really targeting social media managers in contrast in April I'm really opening that up to like number one all businesses all service based businesses because that's what my program is designed for but you can see that shift in my strategy and this is why I'm really trying to get across to people at the moment is you cannot copy and paste someone else's social media strategy off the internet off Instagram you cannot just do or repeat what someone else is doing and finding their success because your pathway is different your goals are going to be different you need to create content that aligns with your goals and what you're trying to achieve and again this is why this point this first step in your strategy is so important now the next thing that's just missing from this particular document is the competitive research and my audience research now I actually have that in another place I have surveys that I've done on Google forms I also have surveys that I've done with my own audience and my customers that are built into my courses so I'm constantly getting feedback there that all comes through my program clickup and for the phase that I'm in in my business I'm very much focused on my audience and my community and understanding them better I don't do a huge amount of competitive research in contrast with a client strategy that I did recently we did case studies on four different competitors and really learning what was the best performing content for them and how we could could apply that to our business so again things are going to be different depending on what phase you're in with your business and I sound like a broken record but what your goals are for some of my students this kind of section of their strategy document could look like screenshots from survey responses from polls they've done on Instagram screenshots of other content they've seen on Instagram that performs really well that they really like or you can take it a step further and you can do some research on Reddit look at some common questions around your Niche or your industry do not sleep on your audience and customer competitor research all of this stuff is so important and what I take from this research is a list of content ideas so if I have a survey response from a student and they're like oh my gosh I love Alan I love that you're like super authentic and the way that you teach but I'd really love for you to focus more on how you edit reals like I haven't seen a video on that I'll be like cool ping that's going to be something that I'm really my my audience is guaranteed to be interested in because they've literally asked me for it another example of this recently seeing it in action was I was getting a lot of feedback from my my students and people in my community struggling with under undercharging for their services so I went ahead number one I did a whole free live event on how what to charge for your services but I did a real recently that's performed really well where I looked at the contrast between what a client demands when they're a cheap client when they're only paying you $300 a month versus a client that's paying you $110,000 a month and and what was really interesting was the comments on this real because comment after comment the words were oh my gosh this is so relatable or oh my gosh this is so true this hits home I feel seen those are the kind of comments you want to be generating with your content you want it to be relatable you want your audience to feel seen by you and the way I come up with those content ideas is listening to my audience doing that research pulling together ideas based off their comments in instead of just copying someone else or the latest trend on reals this is a technique that I use across all platforms YouTube Tik Tok my podcast everywhere I'm listening to my audience and introducing themes and Trends and things that are happening on each individual app but the base of my content is always audience research so this brings me to the where and the how part of our social media strategy and what this looks like for me as you can see on my document it is a very simple straightforward bullet point on here I have clarified my posting schedule one that works for me and it is posting every second day on Instagram I do not post every day this for me creatively leads to burnout and it's actually not sustainable with all the other work that I'm doing in my business and I just want to put this out there because there are very successful creators who are only posting three times a week and who are growing on Instagram so again there are a million different roads to success here on Instagram I want to empower you to find one that works for you and posting every single day is not the only road to success if you can do that if you have the capacity go ahead but you need to make sure that your quality never drops in terms of Tik Tok I post there Monday to Friday just because the content is a little bit more casual and it's easier for me to put out on my podcast I'm posting once a week on Mondays and YouTube is kind of the only one that's at the the bottom of the list and it's like I post on YouTube when I can when I have the capacity let's just quickly touch here on the multi-platform marketing method third you can see that my social media strategy does not just rely on one app when I first started my business I had two platforms Instagram and YouTube Instagram was my nurture platform this was where I converted most sales this was where people could get to know me more and get to know about my office how to work with me come behind the scenes in my day-to-day life or my business YouTube for me was where I got a lot of exposure from the SEO from the suggested videos I've had social media videos that get over you know 40,000 views which is amazing and it brings more people into my circles but generally they won't buy from me directly from that YouTube video they need to come further into my social funnel they need to learn more about me and my office and how I can help them and they do that on Instagram so you can see how these two platforms play together to number one help each other grow because YouTube feeds into Instagram followers and vice versa people who follow me on Instagram can be reminded of when when I upload on YouTube but this really helps me optimize my business and my social media strategy for more sales which at the end of the day is what really matters it's not about the followers it's not about this the the vanity metric and the success in other people's eyes it is about generating sales and making sure your business is actually a business for me at the moment now that my resources have grown I have more money to invest in my business I have contractors who can support me I have expanded to further platforms so my nurture platforms now still Instagram but also email marketing I consider that a social media platform and it's very good for nurturing your audience and getting them to know you more the other platforms I have are Tik Tok this is an exposure platform you can get viral videos here similar to YouTube it also has great SEO there's lots of people searching up videos on social media and mine pop up my podcast I would always Ed to list as a nurture platform and then we started doing really well on the Spotify search engine and we were head around like 9,000 unique people find the podcast just through Spotify search so now it's kind of for me shifted like it shifts back backwards and forth It's a nurture platform because you know it's very intimate being in someone's earbuds for like 40 minutes straight in an episode but it's also something that givs me great exposure so you can have social media apps and platforms that do both and to be fair I do have some viral videos on Instagram so it sometimes falls into the exposure category but for me when it comes to crafting a successful social media strategy in 2024 for one platform is not enough it's not going to grow you very fast the last few things on my where/how category is organizing content on my on my trailer board so really just clarifying how I'm actually going to organize and maintain my content schedule and I also have on here a note that Thursdays and Fridays is when I am doing my content creation so yes I do spontaneously edit the odd real jump on a trend you know utilizing my audience research though first of all that's where the idea will come from but I will make last minute adjustments to my content schedule depending on how I'm feeling however I have a rough outline and a rough draft of edits or a list of videos like here's my videos here's the text that I'm going to add I tend to do that on Thursdays and Fridays for the week ahead so that I am prepared and I know what I'm posting and then the next category moving quite nicely along from that the how I know what to post is my content pillars and my content types so this is the category of your strategy that I explained earlier when I talked about the what what are we going to post for me I have four pillars at the moment FAQs this is very similar to what some people might call an educational content pillar but for me I'm really focusing on what is my audience asking me how can I answer an audience question in my content this is also the place where I get very opinionated I share my opinions on a current Trend or a topic in my industry the second content pillar is behind the business business so this is where I give people insights into what is happening as I said behind the business it kind of like self-explanatory there but this could be a little Vlog it could be a breakdown of the strategy behind a recent launch it could be some of the tools or software that I'm using in my business that are making a big difference shout out again to Riverside this is where I also like to include anything personal about me or my business that might create more of a connection with my audience third content pillar inspirational SL motivational content this is like sometime crosses over with the behind the scenes when I share maybe the stories behind my business when I talk about how I built my business how I got started that kind of hits both those content pillars and that again is okay if you have some crossover here but inspirational content having this content pillar means that every single week I'm hitting there the pain points of my audience in terms of wanting to build their business wanting to get started but feeling scared feeling like they lack confidence that is what that content pillar is really addressing and I really make sure there's something inspiring in my content every single week and the last one is new to me but it's the relatable and humorous content I really like making sure that I have something that's going to make people giggle a little bit and I'm not a comedian I'm not the funniest person in the world but I actually think it's really easy to make humorous content on social media this can be something you can really quickly whip together to fill out your content schedule again some of my top pieces of Performing content on my personal in Instagram page have been funny lipsyncing audios talking about you know crying over client results or a client firing you which has you know appeared it with a funny trending audio I freaking love that audio from a couple of years ago now for House of the Dragon where it was like what's your drink of chice and it's like in NE gron and it's just like this audio went viral everywhere and I used it for so many of my clients and it just performed well every single time and I did one that was all about being um an introvert so again something that related to my audience something that had come up in my research that people really liked about me and my content and related to but I put a funny spin on it and I made it into this funny little story line with this funny trending audio now underneath my content pillars in this document I have content types these are the different types of content that I'm going to be posting on Instagram and again you could adapt this for other platforms we could take Pinterest and be like okay we're going to have a video open we're going to have a graphic image then we're going to have a still image it's the different types or ways that you present your content to the world you could look at LinkedIn and I'm pretty sure LinkedIn does live videos but you could have pre-recorded videos you could have video graphics you could have just text based posts then you could have a live video like there's a whole lot of different features and different ways you can present information or tell your story on social media and for me it's really important to rotate through all of these content types I feel like I could make a whole other video or whole other podcast episode just talking about this but for me you know a real has viral exposure and great growth but a graphic Carousel that really connects with your existing followers and if you're trying to generate more sales making sure you have one of those once a week or twice a week is really important to Showcase case studies to Showcase testimonials to break down your products or your services and I did write out these content types in February when I was very much in my I need viral exposure phase so what I'd written down for me in my content types were lip sync Trends b-roll reels with texts face to cams tips or stories and then voiceover pieces of content so all of these are related to video and again that's also playing into my strength I love creating video content but I also have clients who don't love doing videoos so we do rely on a lot of graphic carousels and that's okay too their content can still perform just as well as mine and again that key message I want to reinforce today everybody's social media strategy is going to be different nobody is right or wrong everybody's just on a different path and you know what it would be hella boring if everybody had the so same way to get followers on Instagram if everybody was doing the same thing and it was guaranteed you get a th000 new followers on Instagram that would be boring but this is often why we get such Whiplash when we research social media strategy because one person is going to be like you need you need to post 7c reels with trending audio and then the other person's going to be like no it has to be original audio and it has to be over a minute and then someone else is going to be like actually I only post graphic posts and I got a million followers so like everybody has a different strategy and that's actually okay what I want you to take away from this is choosing a strategy that works for you choosing one that aligns with your goals first and foremost but also one that fits with your audience in terms of solving their problems and understanding them and understanding your uvp and then of course leaning into your own personal skills or advantages like for me I love the video content so video is going to be a predominant part of my strategy but it doesn't have to be the same for everyone so that's a wrap on today's video I hope you enjoyed these insights I hope it's giv you some inspiration and motivation to build your own personal strategy for whichever platform you enjoy the most if you're watching on YouTube make sure you subscribe and if you're listening on the podcast also make sure you're following on Spotify on Apple make sure you Chuck us a five star review as well because that helps us out so so much and with that all out of the way I will catch you in next week's episode of the dishing up digital podcast bye everyone"
dtxgZNqd3c8,My Personal Branding Strategy to Build a 150k+ Audience Online,Unknown,40101,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dtxgZNqd3c8/hq720.jpg,2022-08-19 00:00:00,327,Guillaume Moubeche,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtxgZNqd3c8,hey lempham how can you build a personal brand that will attract new job offers new business partnerships or even tons of revenue your way that's what we're gonna see in this video the other day kyla wrote to me asking how to build a personal brand the first thing i ask her is three questions and those are the questions you could ask yourself if you also want to build a personal brand the first one is what is one skill or topic that you master second one is what are the things you've learned in the last two years the third one is what is one topic you're passionate about and the first one is what you want to be known for we all have some passion we all have things that we're really good at and often they are kind of tied together for a personal brand it's super important that you stay passionate about what you do because the truth is to build a brand whether it's for your company or a personal brand it takes time and when i say that it takes time it's not something that just gonna take you like two months it's really something that you need to see in the long run whenever thinking about building a personal brand especially if you're starting from scratch think that you're going to invest at least two years of your life talking about a similar topic obviously you can change as you grow you can add more topics etc etc but there is still a consistency that is needed for you to grow your brand so let's look at kyla's answer she loves pinterest marketing content propagation digital production she's passionate about blogging and i'd love a legacy of encouraging people to blog just for fun not for money but just because they've always wanted to try i think this is really interesting here because we can definitely see what kayla has been doing before meaning like pinterest marketing our tagline and her bio is actually about that let's get you going on pinterest however you want to be known for someone encouraging other people to blog just for fun so here clearly the goal of kyla and what she want to be known for is vlogging she has success blogging and she want to inspire more people blogging which is to be honest pretty much what i'm doing here like i'm an entrepreneur i build a very successful companies i sold one another one is worth now more than 150 million dollars but my goal here is just to share the things i love so more entrepreneurs out there can do the same so let's go on our profile as you can see everything is oriented towards pinterest however kyla is really passionate about blogging so personally i would change the bio instead of mentioning pinterest i would focus on the blogging part which could be i give daily tips on how to become a better blogger or you can be even more specific for example i give daily tips for people who've always wanted to blog but never felt confident enough to do it so they can start generate revenue from it or not it depends on what they want to achieve the idea basically here is to be as specific as possible so whenever people see kaila in the comments they see just below our name their bio the bio can generate interest and triggers curiosity which will make you click on one's profile to understand what they do so here i will try to do exactly that same for the banner i would change entirely the banner so it reflects much more what kyle i want to do which is help people blogging the about section is written as if someone else wrote it for me i think it's not something you should do i know that it looks very professional and it looks as if you wrote a book and someone else is writing actually the description about yourself but to be honest on linkedin i would go with something much more casual so for example it could be like hey if you're visiting this linkedin profile it probably means that you are interested in starting a blog actually the reason why i'm sharing all these tips is because in the last years i've reached tens of thousands of people with my blogging or even hundreds of thousands to just add numbers so it looks even more real and i want more people to be able to do the same thing as i did all my tips are genuine and proven tactics that i've personally used to grow my audience and following to xyz again the about section is just to connect even more and build trust with your audience so they start following you engaging with you or messaging you and then build relationships once the profile is redone the strategy is pretty straightforward again i would try to figure out who on linkedin is targeting this audience of people who want to get started blogging and i would start writing thoughtful comments just so my name stand out even more and i drive tons of traffic to my profile here as we can see kyla has 745 followers which is the beginning of her journey but down the line if she keep engaging with a lot of creators content and then post also daily tips about blogging and how to get better at blogging i'm sure personal brand will keep increasing on top of it tons of marketers on linkedin tons of people who want to blog tons of people who like to write so it's literally the perfect place to do that so to sum up if you want to build a personal brand always remember to focus on something you're good at and something you're passionate about it takes time and consistency make sure also to narrow down your niche as much as possible your linkedin profile is like a website your bio is a tagline it's a hook it's what needs to intrigue the reader and the person coming onto your profile the about section is just the beginning of a conversation make sure that you are talking to one person that way it will feel much closer and people will start bonding with your content on top of it starts by engaging with others content especially if you have a very small audience and at the same time write thoughtful and helpful content so your new audience can actually benefit from all the tips and learnings that you've got i hope it was helpful and have a lovely day love you all
-uYTpGonmoI,How to Create Content Pillars for Your Social Media Strategy,Unknown,41691,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-uYTpGonmoI/hq720.jpg,2023-03-06 00:00:00,569,Amber Figlow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uYTpGonmoI,so I know a lot of people keep making a ton of different mistakes when it comes to creating content pillars for their small business so let's break down what content pillars are my secret easy to use formula for Content pillar creation and how you can create content pillars for your small business for super easy and seamless content creation process so first we need to Define what content colors are and what they're not so content pillars it's just a marketing term it's marketing jargon you might have heard it be called something like content buckets content categories but simply put content pillars are way too categorize and systematize content creation for your business it's just an easy way and an easy formula to help you create content consistently for your business that is strategic so there's no more posting just for posting sake we're making sure that every single thing and every piece of content that you put out for your business is strategically aligned to your business and to your business goals and basically it helps you assign different goals for your content and making sure that you're not posting something so Rogue or so out there that it's just a waste of your time so one big content pillar no no is something that I see very very often posted across social media from other experts or gurus out there basically a lot of people will say that their content pillars are education inspiration promotion things like that those are actually content goals and not actually content pillars content pillars again where you have to just think about categorizing your content into these specific little buckets or these little categories so that you're aligning what messaging you're putting out there and you're aligning your content to fit into those buckets so before we dive in further I want to go ahead and give you my content pillars because I'm going to be using them as an example throughout this video so every piece of content that I post on social media would align with one of these content pillars so my five different pillars are going to be content creation tips small business tips I talk about content strategy I talk about content systems and I talk about content goals so basically any content idea that I come up with it has to fit into one of those categories or I simply don't post it so even when I post some of my personal content or I post something that might be a little bit more controversial the message behind it always is geared towards one of those five content pillars I always try and bring it back around to make sure that my content is aligning with those specific pillars so let's dive into my strategy and my super secret formula something that makes me a little different from other marketers out there because I want to give you a system and an approach that is easy for you so a lot of you out there might have already figured out your content pillars but what I like to do to make it a little bit different and again a little bit easier is to align a Content pillar for the day of the week so the reason why I like to do this again it gives you a formula it gives you like a Plug and Play here's what I know what I'm posting on this day here's what I know what I'm posting on this day so basically we want to strategically align that content pillar to a day of the week to make sure that your content is aligned to your audience to your business and to your overall goals so this is where you really have to do a little bit of analysis not only do you have to figure out your content pillars but you also have to start to think about when your audience wants to see that kind of content so for me I don't post any like heavy hitting content towards the end of the week you know things that I want people to go and take action on because I know that I'm talking to small business owners and by Friday they're trying to wind down and get ready for their weekend so for me I like to post more like maybe quick little tips or I try and align my content to fit better at the end of the week for something that is a little bit lighter whereas on Monday I can push things more like content strategy and content systems because business owners are getting into their week and they're geared up and ready to get started so let's give a couple quick examples let's say you're a hair stylist you'll wear five different content pillars might look something like this giving DIY hairstyles talking about hair education curly hair tips products that you use and client Transformations so when thinking about your audience typically speaking most hair stylists in this kind of genre maybe they're talking more towards women with curly hair maybe that's their specialty and you have to think where that woman is going to be at in her week when reviewing your content so for example if you're doing like a product review or recommending products to people think about the end user that woman that is scrolling on a Saturday morning and making sure that that content is going out on a Saturday versus you know middle of the day on a Wednesday so rather than like on a Monday or a Tuesday she's just gearing up for the week she's more in the mindset of like okay I want to learn something and she's not so much on like weekend mode maybe talk to her about curly hair education hair chips things like that or maybe on like Thursday and Friday she's gearing up for her weekend and she wants to see some quiet results before and after maybe before her hair appointment that weekend or she wants some fun DIY tutorials of how she can wear her hair up for her date over on Saturday but basically just think about your audience think about the end user and when they would want to view that content another example as a social media manager you might have a ton of different content pillars so maybe you have things like social media tips social media strategy you're going to share some client results in the transformation maybe you gotta have some content creation ideas and those are the foundations of your content pillars now again if you're a social media manager you're talking most likely to small business owners you're trying to attract them in as a client vast majority of the time small business owners or even CEOs they don't like to work on the weekends and that includes scrolling they are probably spending time with their families they're out and about doing their own thing running errands so you might not want to post content on the weekends just like I do the weekends tend to be lower engagement for me because I know that my target audience my ideal follower is not really taking a look at content on Saturday or Sunday so for you it might look like having Monday and Tuesday showing off client results and talking about social media strategy because a small business owner when they sit down like Monday and Tuesday they're really trying to plan their week they're trying to figure out what they need to do and maybe hiring a social media manager is at the top of the list so you want to align your content with where they are at during the week whereas on Friday they're a little burnt out they're like I'm ready for the weekend maybe give them a fun content creation idea tell them about like a trending audio give them a vlog tutorial or something that's a little bit easier and not as heavy lifting okay so I gave you a couple examples here now how are you actually going to come up with your content pillars I have a couple of steps that they need you to take here first if you're already posting on social media I want you to go and take a look at your analytics and your insights no matter what platform you're posting on vast majority of the platforms no matter where you're at they have some kind of inside tool that allows you to look at your audience insights you know what's working what's not so most of the time on vast majority of these platforms like Instagram or Tick Tock or Twitter there's internal reporting software so it's going to say something like analytics or Insight make sure you have a business account so you can have access to all of those and now once you're taking a look at your analytics and the content that you've posted it's best to go and review your top performing content what is already working for you so you can filter It Out by reach or by saves comments likes shares whatever you want to take a look at just start to find patterns in what content is performing the highest so for me a lot of my education occasional reels or my insightful carousels those always perform really really well for me and so you take a look at the subject matter within them and start writing down those content ideas so for me I used to give out a ton of canva tips tricks and hacks that performed so well for me a couple years back and that was actually one of my content pillars is I literally had a Content Builder all about canva so maybe for that hair stylist a lot of their top performing content is people love to see a brunette going to being a blonde or they love seeing you know you style and updo things like that start to figure out what content performs the best and how you can categorize it so once you've already seen that top performing content and seeing what your audience already resonates with I want you to go ahead and take those ideas the content you've already posted and write it down on a list you can do this in your notes app you can do it on Google Sheets or just go old-fashioned with some pen and paper after you've kind of looked at that high performing content I want you to take that same list and start adding a ton of different content ideas think about all the things that you could talk about related to your profession your career your expertise your business and again just list out a bunch of ideas I want you to try and get to at least 50 different content ideas on this piece of paper or in whatever software you decide to use now once you have let's say all 50 ideas I know it sounds like a lot but once you get going I promise you you're going to think of more things than you realize then this last step is to start to categorize them together so let's say you are a social media manager and you've listed out all these tips you talk about posting times you talk about caption formulas you talk about hashtags that you should be using all of those kind of fit into a category of social media tips and you can start to figure out which types of content ideas fit together and I like to do this again if you're doing pen and paper take out like five different color highlighters and start to highlight okay this one fits together let's highlight it in pink this one fits together highlight that one in pink okay this one over here maybe is a different kind of content and start to categorize it with maybe a different color and again you can follow the same process whether it's in your notes app or Google Sheets just start changing the text to different colors so that you can start to see patterns in those content ideas that eventually help you formulate your content pillars and content pillars really are that simple it's just a process and a system of categorizing your content and now that we've figured out your content pillars you guys can go take a look at this video right here to kind of figure out your content creation method in this video I talk about a ton of different content creation methods whether you like to post in the moment or batch create your content this video will help you figure out which one's right for you oh and if you learned something here today don't forget to hit

4eIDBV4Mpek,How Apple and Nike have branded your brain | Your Brain on Money | Big Think,Unknown,3954381,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eIDBV4Mpek/hq720.jpg,2021-07-27 00:00:00,335,Big Think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek,"- Coke is just soda. Tylenol is just acetaminophen. And Levi's are just jeans. Yet consumers go out of their way to select these specific
brands over others. - An economist would say, ""How is this possible, that a rational consumer
would be willing to pay more for exactly the same thing?"" We love to think about
ourselves as rational. That's not how it works. A very famous study done by
colleagues at Duke University flashed either the Apple
logo or the IBM logo to two randomized groups of participants. - The study found that after being subliminally exposed to the Apple logo, compared to when you'd been exposed to the IBM logo, participants performed
better on creative tasks. - And the argument is that
Apple has been telling you this story over and over again, that Apple is the brand for
hip, cool, fun, creative people. - This is the true power of brands. They can influence our behavior in ways that extend way beyond the point of sale. So to what degree can
the influence of brands wreak havoc on our ability to make rational spending decisions? This is your brain on money. This is Americus Reed. He studies identity and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania. When I make choices
about different brands, I'm choosing to create an identity. When I put that shirt on, when I put those shoes
on, those jeans, that hat, someone is going to form an
impression about what I'm about. So if I'm choosing Nike over Under Armour, I'm choosing a kind of
different way to express affiliation with sport. The Nike thing is about performance. The Under Armour thing
is about the underdog. I have to choose which of these different conceptual pathways is most consistent with
where I am in my life. - And once a consumer makes that choice, their relationship with a
brand can deepen to the point where they identify with
that brand like family. And once you identify with a brand, it can shape the way you behave. - And it's really interesting
because they will also, if someone talks bad about that
product, brand, or service, they will be the first
to go out and defend. Why? Because an attack on the brand
is an attack on themselves. - Michael Platt is a professor of neuroscience, marketing, and psychology whose research demonstrates how our perception of brands
influences our decisions. - There's an idea in
marketing, which is that we relate to brands in the
same way we relate to people. It's like, ""I love this brand,""
or, ""I hate this brand."" Of course, what people
say, right, can often be different from what's really
going on in their heads. So we thought, ""Well, why don't we just ask the brain directly?"" - Michael and his team
observed the brains of iPhone users and Samsung Galaxy
users with an MRI machine while they heard good,
bad, and neutral news about Apple and Samsung. - Apple customers showed a brain empathy response toward Apple that was exactly what you'd see
in the way you would respond to somebody in your own family. - Strangely, Samsung users didn't have any positive
or negative responses when good or bad news was
released about their brand. The only evidence that Samsung users showed was reverse empathy for Apple news. Meaning if the Apple
headline was negative, their brain reflected a positive response. - You know, it really shows us that Apple has completely
defined the market here. Samsung customers, it seems,
from their brain data, are only buying Samsung
'cause they hate Apple. - The kicker? The Samsung users didn't report feeling the results their MRIs showed. What was happening in their brains and what they reported feeling
towards Apple and Samsung, were totally different. - Most people just don't realize that they are subconsciously
choosing brands because those brands have some kind of self-expressive value. - You can see there's a lot of power here in terms of shaping consumers' decisions. As we learn more and more about that, we have to think much more deeply about the ethical, legal, and societal
implications of doing that. - So, as consumers, what can we do to make informed choices? Well, the best thing we can do is to be aware of the influence
that brands hold. - I think it's important to always pause and think a little bit about, ""Okay, why am I buying this product?"" - And like it or not, brands aren't going anywhere. - I've heard lots of people push back and say that, ""I'm not into brands."" I take a very different view. They're not doing anything
any different than what someone who affiliates
with a brand is doing. They have a brand, it's
just an anti-brand brand. And I think about, what is it that I've learned
about identity over time? I think a lot of it has to do with the fundamental need
that we as humans have to have support systems. Perhaps it was the church,
it was the community, it was these other
institutions that existed. Now, brands have stepped in
as pillars of our identity. So I'm very much motivated to see that in that positive light."
PLkGIcrv7JI,Real Social Media Strategy Example and Walkthrough,Unknown,136406,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLkGIcrv7JI/hq720.jpg,2022-01-10 00:00:00,1628,Latasha James,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLkGIcrv7JI,"Hello, everyone. What's up and welcome back to my
channel or welcome to my channel. If you're new today, I'm very
excited to share a real life strategy presentation with you all. I'm going to be sharing the social
media strategy for kind of my school, my, my education business, the online. Launch lab. We just started up social accounts
for that website and platform. So I'm going to share the strategy
that I put together for this. It started out being kind of a mock
strategy, but as I got into it, I was like, I guess this is the real thing. And these are actually real ideas
that we probably should try. So if you haven't yet seen my video on
how to create a social media strategy, I'll be sure to link that would be
low in the description and up in the. So you can check that out if you
want a little bit more detailed, but I'm gonna walk through kind of
a lot of the decisions I made and why I made them in today's video. Okay. So this title page here, I think
it's really important to adopt the client's branding if you can. So what I did is I used the
OELL brand fonts for the title. Also, this is also, it
will be all brand fonts. Well, keeping my own personal logo
here, just to add that branded element, it's also nice to add some screenshots
of their mock-ups of something that they already have or something that
you mocked up for them to sort of help them paint the picture of what it
is that you're really trying to say. It took a quick screenshot of
our existing Instagram feed. And then I added their
logo up here in the corner. I also will say that I do have a
social media strategy template in the social media management toolbox. I'll link that down below as well. It is very bare bones and
that is done with intention. It is done because I don't want
people just using, you know, a certain template because it looks really cool. I think it's really important. Add in your client's branding or your
own branding or a little of both, you know, to make it really come to life. So I will link that down below. All right. So the first thing that
I go into is goals. Just the overall business
slash social media goals. This is something that's really
important to get aligned on. You hear me talk about it all the time? You know, you can't really develop
a strategy without understanding what the goals are now. Ideally you would have already talked to
the client in either a discovery call or. Been working with them
for a while already. So these goals should
be determined together. These aren't things that I'm
just pulling out of the air. So for all the goals are
one to drive core sales. That's the number one
goal is revenue ripe. But number two is to establish OBL
L brand authority, which means, you know, to establish that trust. Our students and with the overall
online business community, I've had courses for years, I've been sort of
the face of the courses for years. Okay. I guess my internet glitched right
at this exact moment, ignore my face. But what I was saying is I've had
courses personally for years, but we'll be LL is still a new brand. So we want to really elevate the
brand and not just me, the person. And we also want to generate leads. For pros and our directory. So the cool thing about the online
business launch lab is once you take either the almond business launch
lab accelerator, or the social media management accelerator, and
you complete those with a passing score, you actually get added to a
little directory that we created. I only have a certain amount of hours in
the day, so this is nice because I can pass off work that I'm not able to take
on to those people who have already. Proven that they know what they're doing. So I also want to make sure that
with OELL we're generating leads for those people and really building
ourselves up as a platform that enables people to, you know, find, find
good freelancers to work with them. Okay. So what I go into here is I go into
a little mini audit of the website, web and social work together. I'm not a web designer or web
strategist or conversion optimization person or anything like that. But I do have to know a little
bit as a social media manager or a social media strategist. We do have to understand web a little
and we need to also make recommendations. We need to do our due diligence
to make recommendations for them. So I just give like the top three things
that they should work on on their website. Add social media icons. That's a quick and easy when there. Um, social icons in the header
or in the footer of the website. So if we're looking to build those
channels, it makes sense to add that, uh, ad GA Google analytics and the Facebook
pixel, those have not yet been installed in the website, which doing that will
enable us to, um, read better analytics. And it will also enable us
to like retarget people. So if they come look at a
course, but don't purchase a course, we can send an ad out. Hey, did you forget this? You left this in your cart that. And then I also added maybe consider
a blog because we don't really have any SEO content on the website
itself, so that will help drive organic traffic through Google. And it will also give us a consistent
stream of content that I can then repurpose and use for social. So that's just an example
of what I would recommend. I also usually add this thing
here, that click for full report. I didn't for this example, because. There really, isn't a lot to audit. It's a brand new website and
a brand new social channel. So it's not like we've been
making, you know, years of mistakes and have all these, you know,
funky things on our website. But what I normally do is they do
a full web and a full social audit. So that is just simply like listing out. Okay. Website, page one, you misspelled. Business or whatever the menu
needs to be condensed a little bit. You have like 80 different menu items. And I go through, you know, page by page. And then I also do the same thing
for social, I'll say, okay, Facebook, you post once a week, you should be
posting all these three times a week. Instagram, you're not posting
stories at all that kind of thing. And I do like a really in-depth audit for
clients that already have a presence and have already been doing stuff for a while. Okay. So then I do the same
thing for social media. Like I said, didn't do the full report
for the same reason, but the posting schedule is the biggest opportunity area. That is again, a really quick win for
OBL L we're not posting consistently. So I just said increased posting
frequency on pillar platforms, which right now are really Instagram. But we'll talk about that later to
a minimum of three times per week. As well as three times per week on
stories, it also said, um, consider adding some new platforms to the mix. We're really only focusing
on Instagram right now. So consider repurposing some of that
Instagram content onto Facebook. That's a really quick, easy win. Of course, we would want to
build out a specific strategy. You know, a strategy specific to Facebook
at some point, but for now a really easy way to just have a presence on
the platform is to just repurpose a lot of what we're doing on Instagram. Also repurpose into LinkedIn. Uh, we'll talk again more
about platforms in a second. Brand advocates is also important. So I think that we can leverage
user generated content and stories. Highlights. We've had a lot of people tag us already
saying, Hey, I just signed up for the online business launch lab accelerator,
or I love this course or whatever. And we can easily highlight
those things onto our page to help with that brand authority. And also. Focus on courses and alumni. I really, of course I am the
face of the brand, if you will. I'm the lead instructor. I'm the only instructor right now,
really the only full-time instructor. But over time, I, you know, I really
want the brand to be more about you all more about the students and the
awesome things that you all go on to do after you take these courses. Versus just Mimi, Mimi, me, you know,
that's kind of why I created this. So that's something that we
want to lean into as well. And then again, the full
report, which doesn't exist. All right. So then I just have
mapped out here sometimes. It's nice for clients to see sort
of a visual, especially when you start talking about a platform like
Instagram, where there's like highlights there's stories, there's reels,
there's all these different things. And we have to remember that. Not everybody else is in it. Like we are, they're not
fully immersed in this world. I mean, a lot of my clients just
think of an Instagram story means an Instagram post or an Instagram
ad means an Instagram post. So putting things together visually,
like this has been really helpful for just those top priorities. Like here's what we're going to focus on. This week, like right now. So add new stories, highlights
and update our stories daily. And then I would probably also
walk through with my client and explain here's what a story is. It lasts for 24 hours, unless we
pin it to one of these highlights here, create alumni features and
highlight course reviews regularly. So that's something we're just not doing. We get new course reviews all the time. Our alumni are always
doing really cool things. Like I said, so why don't we bring
them in for an interview or, you know, just share a picture of them or
share a screenshot of their website or whatever, just fun things like that. Also get on a consistent posting
schedule, ideally five times per week. So we already kind of talked about that. Consistency is an easy one. Okay. Um, then I just sort of mapped out like
what I would envision the highlights to be so business that one's okay. I don't know. We could probably remove that to be
honest, because it only happens once a. Um, and if you don't know
businesses like a vlog, miss challenge that I did podcasts. So that is still in existence
through online business launch lab podcast, audio series. So that's fine. FAQ's, that's good because people,
you know, when they have questions about the courses, and then I also
recommended adding a courses highlight and an alumni highlight because
we don't actually have like a menu of all the courses that we create. And, you know, when they're open, if
the doors close to them, all that kind of stuff, as well as reviews, that's
the place where we can put those. And then alumni, I kind of
already talked about that. Just sharing the cool stuff
that our alumni is doing. Then I go into a hashtag library. So I always like to include this in,
it does take quite a bit of work. This one, I'll be honest. It's actually not fully complete,
but I'll show you what it looks like. This is something I decided actually,
as I was putting this together too, I'm going to go ahead and add this to
the social media management toolbox. Hopefully it's up by the
time this video is up. If not, I'm going to add it
this week, because I think it's a pretty helpful tool. I just developed this simple
Excel sheet or Google. I'll zoom in a little bit. So I it's kind of like a matrix. So we use these top three content pillars. We'll talk about content pillars in
a little bit in this presentation, but I have all of the three content
pillars are the areas of focus. That we are, that we're going to focus
on listed out here under category. And then we have under 100 K in
volume, 100 to 500 K in volume and 500 K to 1 million in volume. And what I mean by volume is if you type
these hashtags into the Instagram search bar, you'll see a number that pops up. That means that's how
populated those hashtags are. So how many images or pieces of
content are housed within that? Courses as specific to Instagram, but
you can do use this hashtag library for all platforms that you are on. If you have a LinkedIn strategy, you can
do the same thing on LinkedIn, et cetera. So I usually build the library
based on Instagram, because that's the platform that I think
hashtags are the most relevant on. So anyhow, um, I just go in and I try to. I tried to add, um, 10 different
hashtags to each bucket. So it does take some time. And as you can see, it's not done yet. Like for some of these, I just
have one, but I started building out it out last night, just so
you could see what it looked like. And the reason I like to add 10 is
then you can just kind of mix it up and create your own hashtag sets. So you can say, okay, like, I'm
going to take one from each of these. I'm going to take one from
each of these and just. Uh, but you know, so you're having
a good variety of larger hashtags, smaller hashtags, more niche, hashtags,
hashtags, based on pillar one pillar, two pillar three, you get the gist. Okay. So then for some of these secondary
platforms, I just go in and I list out priorities for those platforms as well. So for LinkedIn, I think we can just start
sharing podcast clips onto the OBL L page. We haven't shared
anything on that page yet. And it's just kind of silly not to at
least just repurpose the video podcast clips, people like that kind of content
on, on LinkedIn, at least what I've seen when I used LinkedIn a lot more regularly. So let's do that. We can also encourage alumni interaction. So I personally. On my personal LinkedIn page, I get
tagged pretty often from people who have, you know, finished a course
and have their certificate, people who are enrolling in a course. And I love that. And I always make sure that I log
in, you know, every day or every couple of days and check those and,
you know, respond to those folks. And I love seeing them. They make me really happy, but. Well, we can do is we can also encourage
them to tag the OBL elec how, instead of just my personal account, it's just a
great way to generate traffic to the OELL page versus just my own personal profile. And then we can also announce the
directory via my own profiles. So again, I have, like, I have quite
a bit of connections from, you know, working in the corporate world. I think I have like 3000
or something like that. Connections on LinkedIn. And I actually. Messages all the time from people I used
to work with saying, Hey, do you have somebody to recommend for, you know,
as a social media manager or whatnot? So I can create a post on my personal
profile saying, Hey everyone, if you're looking to hire people, I have this
great directory on OELL follow the page and we'll highlight some of those. Members and things like that. So that's just an easy, quick way. And I can just log in. I don't post a ton on LinkedIn these
days, but just posting a little update so people know where I am and where
they can keep up with me is an easy win then same thing for Facebook here. I just have some priorities
or some quick wins. First we can repurpose existing content. Pretty much everything we're posting
on Instagram would work on Facebook. So let's just start doing that
just to sort of populate the page. And we can also consider creating
an alumni only Facebook group. I think this is a really good
opportunity to have some place for all of our alumni to go and network. I do have the freelance Friday
club, which is a paid group. Um, but for those who may be just, you
know, aren't really ready to invest in something like that, or just want
to see things come through their feed. I think this is a good opportunity for us. And then we also may want to
test an advertising strategy. So right now, I have I've I probably total
for all my courses over the years, I've spent like a hundred dollars in ads ever. So I think there's a lot of
opportunity that we can test out with retargeting for those abandoned carts. So people who go to the OELL
website, look at a course and then decide, Nope, not for me. We can retarget them. We can, um, you know, do a lot
of fun things with advertising. At least why not test it out to see
if we can really pull the lever on what's already working in selling. Okay. Then we go into our content pillars. So content pillars are basically
the three main areas that you want to focus on with your social
media or your content strategy. I don't recommend any more than
like two to three main content pillars, because then you start
to really confuse the audience. So for this brand, what we're focusing
on, and I always like to create like little fun names for them, but I guess
you don't have to, you could probably just say freelancing, learning, whatever. I like to make it a little fun. And again, for the client, when you're
presenting this report to them, it just really feels, I don't know. It feels nice. It feels creative. If you have some, some fun
little story to tell about it. Okay. So first we're gonna focus on
being sustainably self-employed so we're going to provide. Tips resources for building online
businesses that are in it for the long haul and for the right reasons. So if you're new here, hi, I'm Natasha. I hate get rich quick schemes. I hate scams. I hate all of that stuff. I am all about building an
organic first business, um, slow and steady wins the race. I have been in it for a while. It is hard, but it is worth it. It is doable if you build
those foundations up. Right. So that's really something
that I want to focus on. I don't want to be like,
Hey, join this course. And you'll get rich, you know, in a day. Like that's not how it works. And I don't ever want to mislead
people into thinking that that is what our programs offer. Our programs offer you. Sustainable business advice and tips. Okay. Um, then the second pillar
is learned from the best. So we are providing university comparable
education from pros who are doing it big. So my idea for, especially for the
accelerator programs that I offer, the online business launch lab accelerator
and the social media management accelerator were to offer something. I really modeled them after. Courses that I've been in. Um, you know, we meet
for a lecture every week. You have homework and assignments and
things to work on, and then you have small groups that you work on, um, you know,
collaboration and networking with as well. And I really modeled that after a
university level class, because I think that's something that's missing
in the online education space. I don't want to just offer templates
and just, you know, things like that. I want it to be really immersive
and high level and challenging. Challenge is what helps us grow. And then the last one is at your service. So we want to position OBL Al not just
as an education hub, but also as a hub for building an online business
in other ways, including outsourcing. So if you take an OB ELL class and you
decide, okay, I'm going to create a. And you decide, okay, now I need
to find somebody to edit these videos for me because that's not,
I don't, I don't know how to edit. Well, we, now we have a directory where
you can go and find video editors to help you build your online business. If you are, you know, an online
bookkeeping service and you need to find a social media. We have people who are available
to be at your service and provide you those resources. So those are the pillars
that we're going to focus on. And then here, I just share a
little samples either mock-ups or I'll share things that they
already have on their pages that. Demonstrate these different pillars. So sustainably self-employed
here on the left. We have make it easy to pay you. This is like a little carousel
that I created with just some three, you know, three tips on
how to make it easy to pay you. Right. Use ACE. You know, invoice on
time, things like that. And then over on the right, we
have some of our freelance Friday club members and course alumni who
provided some of their tips on, I think it was pricing tips because
this is something that comes up a lot. How do I price my services? So I said, let me ask some of our
alumni what they recommend to not only shine a light on them, but
also to provide that information to help you become sustainably. And then I'll just list out a
couple of content ideas as well. Like we can do some tips and tricks,
some tips and advice, kind of carousels with different topics,
pricing, topics, getting paid. I'm finding clients like all
of these things that we get asked about all the time, alumni
quotes, just like I just showed. Um, and then also saveable motivation. I feel like there's a better
term I could use for that one. I kind of. Yesterday. So be, be easy on me if some of this
isn't perfect, but yeah, just like creating some posts that make people
want to save, make people want to share in their stories of, you know, that,
Hey, keep going, you got this, you know, business is hard, but you can do this
kind of little motivational, um, tips. I know. Really PR performed quite well. I might even share some
examples of what I mean by that. Like I said, maybe either doing a
mock-up or if I was really presenting this to a client sharing some
accounts that are doing this that are kind of what I have in mind. Cause I know that might
not make sense to a client. A lot of you guys watching that
probably will make sense cause you are in this space, but you know, for
a client, I might have to really, um, give them a screenshot of what I mean. Second pillar is learned from the best. So we have a screenshot, um, or a sample
of a podcast interview that we did with daily Barkley loved that interview. She's also on YouTube. If you want to look her up by the
way, and then on the right, we just have a screenshot of one of my
tweets, so we can do podcast snippets. We can do a weekly check-in with me,
which I think is really important of either getting on a live every
week, getting on stories every week. You know, sharing like a little tip
via a Twitter screenshot or something like that to have that sort of, to help
with positioning that brand authority. Because again, this is a new brand,
so people don't know who online business launch shop is, but you know,
more people know who I am than they know who online business non-top is. Right. So if I can. Associate myself with that brand and
kind of help lead the charge on that until it, it develops wings of its own. If you will. I think that's really important. And I think this is something I
know it's kind of weird cause I'm like talking about myself, but you
know, when you're working with. If you can, in most cases, obviously
depends on what type of brand, what type of business it is. But having that CEO or leadership
involvement is really important in today's day and age. I think it's quite hard to run a business
and not have the CEO have a presence. Um, so I always try to push that to their
comfort level, of course, respecting that, but Hey CEO, or, you know, CML
or whoever's comfortable beyond camera or help, whoever is comfortable having
a Twitter account, you know, I think it's really important that you develop
your personal brand alongside the brand. So that's something I also like to
mention in this, in this part here. And then of course, FAQ's previews review. Things like that. And then the last one at your service
that we have here, a screenshot of, um, a video review of our,
one of our accelerator courses. And then on the right, we have a
picture of me where I'm kind of, the caption was me introducing myself. So content ideas for this
would be directory highlights. So let's pull a directory
member of the week. That's something really easy that
we could start doing like tomorrow. So I'm actually putting that on my
list to talk about with my team. Let's start doing that
alumni interview clips. We have. Tons of alumni interviews that
we do after the courses wrap. So, and they've given us
permission to use them as well. So why don't we just share a little
highlights, little stories of who our alumni are, what they are up to nowadays. I think that's really important to kind of
close the loop and share what's possible and then just growth tips and stories. So maybe like, um, Again, kind of how I
shared that example of the course creator. Right? You take OELL you decided you want
to start a course, create a course. Well, now you need a video
editor and then maybe you need a copywriter to help you or whatever. So maybe showing some of those
journeys of, um, what teams look like. Because I think sometimes people
get really overwhelmed with online business and they're like, I
can't do all of this by myself. And it's a lot easier with the. So sharing sort of how
that stuff is possible. I also made a note in
here about leveraging UGC. So I told you about this a little bit
earlier, you know, a lot of people tag me here's promise, lovely promise. She finished her, um, the
social media management roadmap. And so she tagged me, which I loved. Thank you for tagging me. And I responded to her again, this is
something that, you know, we could reach out to promise and ask if we could have. Do a little interview with her, or
if we could just, you know, share this onto the OB LL LinkedIn account,
as opposed to just on my personal LinkedIn profile and leveraging UGC. So UGC is user generated content. So this is, you know, when somebody
is tagging you in an Instagram story, when somebody is tagging you on
LinkedIn, things like that, you can use this to your advantage because I
always always say, you know, your best customers are your best marketers. So this post alone is. For the brand, you know, the me just
saying, Hey, the social media management roadmap is an awesome course, like
no, here at, from the actual student. So anyway, I like to make a
note of that and then some more ideas that we could use for UGC. We could do some, um, Instagram
real or story takeovers with alumni. So why don't we reach out to some of
our alumni, who's doing cool stuff and say, Hey, do you want to do. Share stories for the day and take
people behind the scenes in a day of your life to share what you're up to now. Um, a quick win would be to add an
Instagram highlight for alumni tags, which I think I mentioned in the,
in the highlight section, adding an alumni tag or an alumni highlight. So whenever people tag us and
Hey, I finished the course or whatever, we can add it there. We can also add a call to action. For when our students complete a course
to tag us on LinkedIn and Instagram. So again, a lot of people
tag me personally, which I love, I'm not mad about. Please keep doing it. Um, but we can also add, Hey, we have
these platforms that up for Oll as well, feel free to tag us on there. And maybe we will repost, you know, we
can kind of add a call to action that encourages them to do that in that way. And then at the end, I just wrap
things up with some next steps. Like where do we go from here? Okay. We talked about a lot of cool ideas. I got your insight. I got your feedback. As I'm talking through this,
now, here's what we need to do to actually make this happen. First thing we're going to make these
quick profile edits me and my team. We're going to go ahead and do. Today, right now, those are
easy things that we can do. You know, adding the story,
highlights, little things like that. Suck to you. I think we can start repurposing content. So we already have a
lot of content created. Why don't we just schedule some
of that stuff out onto Facebook or LinkedIn where appropriate, and then
we can start filling in the gaps with step three, creating new content. Where we, we feel like we need to,
maybe we start rolling on that next week with a deployment date of two
weeks from now, something like that. So, um, yeah. That's let me close this. Okay. So I went through that pretty quickly,
but really that is the main gist of it. I think it's also important to note that
while presenting this report, you know, I would be talking with the client. So I usually schedule these
strategy calls for an hour. So I'm actually hearing from them,
you know, some of these ideas. Oh, no, I don't think our CEO
would like to share about the directory on their personal profile. All right. We'll remove that. And you know, maybe we can revisit that in
six months, if you're not into it, maybe there's something that they really love,
or maybe they have a new idea to you. It's really important to talk to
them, you know, just have a human to human conversation about this stuff. Cause they might have ideas
that you didn't even think of. So yeah. The long story short of how a social media
strategy call would go and what a social media strategy document would look like. Again, if you want to check out the social
media management toolbox, I will go ahead and link that down in the description box. It has a very bare bones, basic
template that you can customize. You can watch this video back
and add some of the different layers to it too, if you want to. So I think that's it. I hope you enjoyed this video. I really hope it was helpful. Please leave me at them's up. If it was. And you can also subscribe to my channel. I post videos every Monday and
Friday, at least sometimes a little surprise in between. I share everything that I know
really about social media strategy, online business ownership, course
creation, uh, just my wild life as an independent professional. So why don't you go ahead and join me
and I hope you all have a fantastic day. I'll talk to you in my next one. Bye."

Solved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCy2adkj4HM,social media engagement is so important because the more people that engage with your content the more people will see your content and the more people that see your content the more people see your products services the more people are going to buy from you and that is money in the bank but today I'm going to show you how you can hack your way through those news feeds to get more exposure to get more engagement to get more eyeballs on your business afternoon Sullivan is the CEO and founder of marketing solve a serial entrepreneur marketing host and educator wants to know this woman what's up guys I'm Kat Sullivan CEO and founder of marketing self and today you're gonna learn social media engagement hacks that you can use in your business right now hack number one post consistently posting consistently is a non-negotiable so if you haven't been posting consistently before it is killing your organic reach Joanna here secret the social media networks actually rewards you for posting consistently so what that means is the more consistent you post the more they will show your content organically which means for free so that's really important and why you want to be posting consistently every single day on those platforms that you want to be found on if you're struggling with posting consistently let me share my favorite social media tool and it's called monthly marketing solve so if you don't have time to create graphics and you don't know what or when to post monthly marketing self gives you a marketing calendar tells you what to post when to post and it gives you the actual content so you can get graphics where you can add your logo to make them customized to your business and you can use statuses and just enter in personalized information for your business making it so easy to stay consistent get more organic engagement and reach more people hack number two leveraging your personal profile so most businesses have a personal profile where you do your interactions with your friends and family and then you have a business profile which is going to represent your business or your brand and just like peanut butter and jelly they're great individually they do well on their own except when you mix them together every now and then the magic happens so this is the same exact idea basically you want to leverage your personal profile to get more exposure to your business now you don't want to do it every day but you definitely want to intermingle the two every now and then because what's gonna happen is when you take a business post for example on Facebook and you share it to your personal Facebook page well if you get some interaction on your personal profile from that shared status from your business page well what happens is your business page reach goes up because now it's in front of your network and it's seeing more people and if your friends and family love you and even if they don't hopefully they will leave you a comment or they will engage with that post in some way what happens is two things one the post the original post on your business page is going to now see more people it's gonna get more exposure it's gonna get more reach and two when your friends and family or even business associates will interact with that post on your personal profile their friends so front friends friends your friends friends your friends friends is your friends of us your friends network will see your post in their newsfeed and surely you've seen it before if you've ever been on Facebook where John Smith commented on Sally's post and what happens is those posts then get even more exposure all because you've simply shared from your business page to your personal profile making a fantastic peanut butter and jelly sandwich hack number three and maybe my most favorite engage first so what that means is that the social networks know you and they know if you're one of those passive scrollers you know the kind you know what I'm talking about you don't leave any comments you don't like anything you see everything but you don't actually engage well what that does is you're telling this social networks hey I'm just a passive user and when you go to post a status well guess what they're like that person's just a passive user so they're not really gonna show your stuff unless you're an active user an active user is someone that engaging with other people first now this is a huge hack and I'm gonna share it with you if you find this ninja hack that I'm about to give you helpful please make sure that you subscribe to our channel so we can continue to bring you the best marketing training 6 what I like to do before I post something is I like to engage first and that means I'll take 10 or 15 minutes and I will go and I'll be an active user I'll go comment on people's profiles that I want to leave thoughtful comments for maybe people that I'm inspired by or people that I think might be a good fit for my programs and that I just want to get in front of and start a conversation the reason I like to take that 10 or 15 minutes first is because then when I post my content those people are most likely going to see it because when you start having a conversation when you start engaging with other people while you're telling the social network hey we're connected in some way so here's how I want you to think about this here's your ninja hack if you're gonna post a new program a new product or something that you know that you've got some friends you've got some people in your network that are a perfect candidate for this new program or new product well if you start interacting and engaging with their content before you post your offer when you do post your offer the networks are gonna say hey these two people were just engaging so let's show this person's new content to this person since they were just having a conversation you're literally hacking your way to get in front of people that you choose by engaging first now that's a hack you can start using right now hack number four is commenting and interacting as your business this works beautifully on Twitter or Facebook even Instagram so what you can do is you can actually go and leave really thoughtful comments now I don't mean hey nice photo great post but something thoughtful but leave it at your business page not your personal profile because if you go and you take a couple minutes every day and you go to the industry influencers or you go to people who have similar products to what you sell why you want to interact with your business because if you can get in front of those people and draw them back to you they see you leaving thoughtful comments well they're gonna click on your profile and instead of them going to your personal they're gonna go to your business page and hopefully they're gonna look at your page they're gonna see your products and they're gonna hopefully engage with your content it works really really great on Twitter because if you're commenting as your business well that goes in front of your network and then it goes in front of if anyone else comments it's gonna go in front of their network and then other people are gonna be drawn in and so you're gonna have your audience and their audience and the original person's audience and everybody's gonna be looking at your business so you're gonna be able to really draw in and attract people to your business that way hacks number five the follow the follow technique follow the follow if you really want to grow your following this is a technique that I use when I was first starting out to really start getting some exposure for myself and it works really well so what I like to do is I like to make sure first you have a completely optimized social media profile that's really really important so that when you start attracting people back to you it's a no-brainer for them to want to follow you what I do is I generally will identify some industry influencers or people that are popular in my niche so let's say for example you're a jewelry designer and you want to get followers of people who are interested in buying jewelry what you would do is you would identify some of the industry leaders in your space and that could be Kendra Scott or Alex and Annie both have really big jewelry lines and then what you would do is you would go and you would look at people engaging with their content well then you can go and start following their followers right like you can start following people that are engaging with content or products that you know are similar to what you sell because what's that what that's gonna do is once they see that oh this jewelry company followed me they're probably gonna click over to your profile and look at your jewelry so it's a really good way to get exposure to get in front of people and to attract them back to you where they can then engage with your social media content and you can do this on any platform it works really really well go follow the followers of people who already have the audience that you want to get in front of they did all the hard work for you so this is really just piggybacking on what they've done follow the follow works hack number six talk to people not at them so this is a really important one when it comes to social media you need to be social on social media right sounds like a no-brainer I know but it's really important that you know when you're creating your social media posts and your statuses that you're leaving it open to people so that they can actually engage with you you want to invite them to talk with you and be a part of the conversation so let me give you an example option a click here to read our blog post or option B here's our brand new blog post I loved number two which one was your favorite well you can tell right off the bat that this one's gonna get more engagement because you've asked for it so it's really that simple you've created an opportunity for your fans for your followers for your readers to actually engage with you and tell you what they think and that's really important so don't be closed off don't talk at them talk to them and encourage them to interact with you that engagement hack is going to get you a lot of engagement engagement hacks seven the comment thump now this is another one of my favorite ninja techniques because it really helps you with exposure so one thing it's important for you to understand is that when you post something on social media it has a lifespan and the lifespan is really short because there's so much content coming into the newsfeed every single day so it's really important for you to understand that each post has a lifespan and how you can actually leverage this to help you get more engagement so let me tell you what I'm talking about well you get about 20 minutes where the algorithms will measure how successful your post is and if it starts to get a lot of interaction in the beginning you'll see that most people will do their likes and commenting in the very very beginning right when you post it so what I like to do is I like to wait until about that twenty minutes is up so if we post something and we get some good comments I don't actually comment right away I wait because I want to get as much organic exposure as I can with that first post so then right before the post lifespan is over I'll go in and I'll start responding to the people that comment it and that is called a comment bump happens is it bumps those posts back up in the news feed which gets it seen by more people and it starts creating a conversation you can leverage the timing of your comments and your responses so that you can reach more people really growing your engagement because then it gets in front of that person's network it's gonna allow you to continue to organically free be seen by more people so the comment but works beautifully engagement hack number eight leveraging Facebook groups so just like we talked about with your personal profile earlier you have different assets that you can use and you should use to help you really hack your engagement you have your own Facebook group this is ideal if you're gonna be sharing your business content into Facebook groups that are not yours make sure you read the rules there's always rules and you don't want to be the person that's not following the rules but you definitely should be leveraging Facebook groups to share your posts from your business profiles in if you have a business post and then you put it in a Facebook group well the exposure immediately goes up and so organically it's going to be seen by more people and if the people in your tribe and in your group interact with that piece of content if they go to your business page and they start interacting well guess what happens that engagement bumps it back up in the newsfeed it gets in front of those peoples Network it gets it in front of your group and it really snowballs the amount of engagement that you're going to get so leverage all the assets that you have available for your business and really hack your way to more social media engagement there you have eight social media engagement hacks that you can use right now in your business
